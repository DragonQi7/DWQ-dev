## Welcome to Dragon’s Way Qigong®

This journey will change your life and the relationship you have with your body forever.  
My approach is based on a system that understands the body’s ability to heal itself.  
I will teach you how to apply that innate healing gift to all areas of your life.

True change is possible if you understand that everything is energy and everything is connected.  
Energy is the body’s life force. The body constantly uses all of its resources to maintain balance.  
When you are off balance, you may begin to notice physical symptoms, weight fluctuations, or emotional highs and lows.

During your Dragon’s Way Qigong® experience, you will learn how to increase your energy and use it to create better health.

## 🐲 A Message from Grandmaster Nan Lu

Billions of people in Chinese culture have used Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) to thrive.  
It has sustained an entire civilization for millennia because it honors the body’s innate ability to heal by providing a roadmap for living in harmony with Nature.

Ancient healers understood prevention as a fundamental requirement for good health.  
Their role was to discover the root cause of illness and bring the body back to balance.  
Now, more than ever, we need this system to support our increasingly stressful lifestyles.

Dragon’s Way Qigong® comes without side effects — only results that allow you to experience life with a newfound sense of freedom.  
You will be able to handle stress differently. Your ability to regain physical, mental, and emotional balance will be greatly enhanced.

Your emotions and relationship with your body will change.  
Your cravings for certain foods will change.  
Your sleep patterns and level of peacefulness will change.

I will help you go beyond your current imbalances and teach you how to use your untapped energy to rediscover good health.

A food’s essence expresses its relationship with Nature.  
That relationship carries a message that resonates deep within the body to promote healthy energy flow.

See page 130 for a suggested eating plan and recommended foods.

## ☯️ Lifestyle

Everything in life — work, eating habits, activity level, emotions, and environment — impacts your Qi.  
Each week, you will learn how to understand the effects of your daily lifestyle from an energetic perspective.

We all want freedom:  
Freedom from illness, fear, and worry — but most importantly, the freedom to live a healthy, happy life.  
Use your energy in a positive way to create the life you want.

## 🌿 Herbal Supplements

Herbs are food. They carry messages of Universal wisdom that energetically support you.  
For thousands of years, TCM has incorporated herbs into healing plans.  
Like the foods in this program, these herbal formulas help build your energetic foundation and allow Qi to move freely.  
This is an optional but highly recommended component.

## ⚡ Everything is Energy

As in many ancient traditions, Chinese masters studied the link between humanity and Nature.  
Through meditation and observation, they discovered that everything is energy — and all energy is consciousness.

You are an energy being. Your body reflects your inner life.  
Imbalances first appear on the energetic level; if not addressed, they manifest as physical symptoms such as weight issues, pain, or illness.

Symptoms are the body’s way of asking for support.  
Maintaining the free flow of energy is the key to good health.

## 🌬 About Qi — You Are an Energy Being

All life contains Qi — the animating force that guides you through life and determines your health and well-being.

You are born with a finite amount of inherited Qi from your parents.  
This quality cannot be changed; it depends on your parents’ health.

Your daily activities draw upon this energy. To stay balanced, you must continually acquire more Qi from external sources.

Learning how to acquire and use Qi is the essence of Dragon’s Way Qigong® — the secret to health, longevity, and vitality.

To understand energy’s relationship with your body, we turn to the Five Element Consciousness Framework.

## 🌏 Five Element Consciousness Framework

Ancient masters recognized that all life — human, animal, plant, or cosmic — is connected.  
They developed a blueprint to “see” the energetic relationships between all things.

In this framework, each of Nature’s five elements — Wood, Fire, Earth, Metal, and Water — is linked to:

- An organ system  
- An emotion  
- A color  
- A taste  
- And other natural correspondences  

If one organ is imbalanced, the others compensate to restore harmony.  
The body is a microcosm of Nature.

## 🩺 Decoding the Body’s Symptoms

- Craving sour foods? That’s your Liver speaking.  
- Feeling constant worry? That points to your Stomach.  
- Sadness or grief may indicate issues with the Lungs.  

Symptoms are not random; they are messages from your energy system asking for balance.  
The Five Element Framework helps you decode these messages.
