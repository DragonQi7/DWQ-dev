2
Eating-for-Healing Plan

Our recommended eating style supports the body’s need for energetic balance. Dragon’s Way Qigong encourages a positive relationship with food, suggesting foods that energetically support different organ systems. View our Sample eating plan.

Five Element Consciousness Understanding

With access to the ancient Five Element Consciousness Framework, you’ll begin to understand the body’s messages or signs from a new perspective. The body continually talks to us through messages such as emotional upset, headaches, joint stiffness etc. This framework helps us decipher what the body needs rather than worry about what’s wrong.  A new sense of freedom becomes your way of living.

Like foods, herbs contain a unique essence to support the body. The herbs formulated for the Dragon’s Way Qigong program help the body return to a state of balance. If you are struggling with many health issues, including excess weight, herbal support is highly recommended.

Lifestyle Guidance

Our fast-paced society is filled with stressors at every turn. So how do we slow down and incorporate these teachings into our daily lives? By tuning into the body’s wisdom, you’ll learn to truly listen and respond to what the body is asking for.

## Benefits of Qigong energy exercises

Qi is the guiding force that informs every aspect of body, mind, and spirit. This invisible energy flows through the body's meridians. When Qi flows freely, the body expresses health, vitality, and creativity. When Qi is blocked, imbalance appears and can manifest as physical or emotional pain — messages pointing to deeper energetic issues.

> “Deep down, everything is energy, and underpinning our reality is a state of Oneness. We are all connected to everything—worlds within and the world without. When energy flows freely and the body works in harmony, disease and illness have no place to live.” — Grand Master Nan Lu

Qigong means "energy work." Through movement and standing meditative postures, we help the body break through blockages and restore the free flow of Qi. With consistent practice you build an internal reserve of energy the body can use to heal. We call this "Healing Without the Mind."

## Testimonials

### Chelsea’s Story: Finally Free

In July 2018 I experienced extreme fatigue and joint pain. Walking became a challenge. After a Lyme diagnosis and treatment I still felt unwell and spiritually drained. After completing the 7-Day Journey to Heart Harmony and the Healthy Liver, Healthy Life 7-Day Intensive, I continued with Dragon’s Way Qigong under an instructor recommended by TCM World.

During practice I experienced episodes of vomiting — initially concerning, but guided by my instructor I continued and realized these were a flushing and transformation process. I no longer suffer joint pain or fatigue; I feel physically and mentally rejuvenated.

### Kate’s Story: Release From Back Pain

I’m a nurse and had chronic back pain for 10 years. About two weeks into Dragon Kicks Backward, I felt a release in my stomach and lower spine — the pain disappeared. Regular practice has helped me stay pain-free and restored my physical and mental wellbeing.

— Kate Hargreaves

### Alex’s Story: Accepting the Way of the Dragon

I began Dragon’s Way in March 2017 at about 320 lbs and felt chronically unwell. After a year I lost 75 lbs and changed my eating habits. Practicing outdoors one morning, I felt connected to the earth and experienced a deep emotional shift. The program helped me balance my digestion and reclaim my health.

### Jeff’s Story: Healing the Dragon’s Way®

I discovered Dragon’s Way at the Building Bridges conference while completing CE credits for acupuncture. The program opened healing energy throughout my body. With continued practice I saw improvements in shoulder, hip and neck pain, mental clarity, calmness, and sleep.
