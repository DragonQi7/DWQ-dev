have to go with flow
don't include TAO or 5Element in book title

different personality have different illness

can't go wtih flow because emotions are stuck

why are they stuck because there are thing in life you can't accept

you cant be all you can be all inclusive.

so you deny and block that create this block.

you have to accept deeply acccept

health and emotions are the same.
most modern illness are related to your emotions.

have to let you emotiosn flow
but how?

that's what I'm here to teach you

you can't just tell everyone how you feel.

you hvae to sensitity and sensiblity

you have to have good timing
who, what when where.

you have to know what to say and what not to say

you have to be able to speak without speaking
the more youspeak the more confusion it causes
because the words are no truth
because feelings are true
and rarely are words enough to express the whole truth 
about how you are feeling.

dont' limit yourself dont' choose
there is a sense of freedom in no but no real freedom in no
say yes but can also mean no

level and balance


hard workd but there are blessings - grace happenshi
