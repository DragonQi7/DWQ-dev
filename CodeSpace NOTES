Pushing to DWQ-prod (note i havent tried this yet)

The difference is in which remote repository you are pushing your changes to:

git push origin main pushes your changes to the "origin" remote, which is usually your main development repository (DWQ-dev).

git push prod main pushes your changes to the "prod" remote, which is your production repository (DWQ-prod).
Use origin to update your development repo, and prod to update your production repo. Let me know which one you want to push to!


commiting vs pushing
Committing saves your changes to the local git repository with a message, creating a snapshot. Pushing uploads those committed changes from your local repository to a remote repository (like GitHub), making them available to others.

Committing is similar to saving a snapshot of your changes locally in your workspace's git repository. It tracks changes and history, but does not move files to any remote server until you push.

commit and push
