C: Plot the Earth Plate
Two things you need to know before you can
PLOT the Earth Plate
1: The 3 Noble 6 Crescents
The Earth Plate of a Qi Men Dun Jia Chart consists of TWO layers of Heavenly
Stems. These Heavenly Stems are known as the 3 Noble 6 Crescents
(San Qi Liu Yi). There are a total of 9 Heavenly Stems used in Qi Men
Dun Jia -
The first step involves arranging the 3 Noble 6 Crescents

these 9 Stems only follow the REVERSE (Yin Flow).

Plotting the Earth Plate Stems
Place Wu Ji at the original sector of the Structure Number in the Luo
Shu Chart.
Take note that the Luo Shu Numbers relate to the "starting" point of the Ji
Wu Stem. This means, if it is a 1 Structure, we should start with Wu Stem
in the North. If it is a 2 Structure, we start with Ji Wu Stem in the Southwest.
If it is a 3 Structure, we start with Ji Wu Stem in the East.
There are two types of structures: Yin Structure and Yang
Structures
If it is a Yang Structure, the stream of Stems beginning with Wu Stem will
be allocated in the FORWARD path of the Luo Shu.
If it is a Yin Structure, the stream of Stems beginning with Ji Wu Stem will
be allocated in the REVERSE path of the Luo Shu.

Example 1:
If we have a Yang One Structure we should place the Wu Ji Stems
in the Kan 3k (North) Palace. Then continue to plot the rest of the Stems
following the Forward Cycle to the rest of the Palaces. The reason we
follow the Forward Cycle of the Luo Shu this time is because this is a YANG
structure.

D: Plot the Heaven Plate kü
Step 1:
After plotting the Earth Plate Stems, we will now proceed to plot the Heaven
Plate Stems. To do this, you must first find the Lead Stem of the Earth
Plate This is done by referencing the Yearly Stem's location in the Luo
Shu.
Refer to the Six Jia Streams Leader Table below to find the Lead Stem if
of the Earth Plate based on the Year Pillar. The location of that Stem
is the beginning point of the Heaven Plate

Step 2:
The Circular Path
To plot the Heaven Plate, we need to follow the "Circular Path" method. From
Step 1, after you've determined the location of the Lead Stem if f, arrange
the Stems of the Earth Plate, in a Circular Path around the Chart to
form the Heaven Plate.
Please note that Heaven Plate is plotted following the Circular Cycle in Qi
Men Dun Jia. This is different with the plotting of the Earth Plate Stems which
is plotted following the flow of the Luo Shu path.
Circular (Clockwise) Cycle arrangement:
If the Starting Point is from Qian, then it will continue on as follows:

Let's take the assessment date of February 26, 2012. Based on the Index
Section (Page a4 to a9), February 26 is a Ding Si T C Day. It is a Yang Three
Structure, under the Middle Cycle.
Step 1:
Refer to the Six Jia Streams Leader Table, and we will find that Ji Si
Day belongs to Wood Rat Stream , and the Lead Stem is Wu n. Place
Wu Ji Stem at the Ji Day Stem's location. In this case, it is located at the

E: Plot the 8 Doors
The Eight Doors are allocated on the Qi Men Chart using the CIRCULAR
clockwise method.
The task here is merely to determine WHICH of the 8 Palaces in the Qi Men
Chart will begin the 8 Door allocation.
1. In order to plot the 8 Doors, we first need to determine WHICH is the
Lead Door or better known in Qi Men Terms — the Envoy Location
- and where this door is located in our Qi Men Chart.
2. Then, from the location of the Earth Plate Lead Stem calculate
using the Day Pillar's Stream Leader, using the Luo Shu Path all the way
UNTIL you reach the Day Pillar. This Palace is the START position of the
8 Doors.
3. Locate the Envoy in the start position and plot in a CIRCULAR method
the rest of the 8 Doors.

Envoy :
To find out where the Envoy of the chart is located, we need to refer to this
BASIC NATAL Chart of the 8 Doors.
Bear in mind that:
We need to observe the Yin and Yang Dun. So it is important to know if
the Chart belongs to the Yin or Yang flow. If the date of the assessment
belongs to a Yang Dun, this means we need to use the FORWARD Luo Shu
Path. If it is a Yin Dun (Yin Flow) Chart, this is means a Reverse Luo Shu
Path is used.

Basic Natal Chart of the 8 Doors
Remember - the location of the Earth Plate Lead Stem is known as
the Envoy Door or the Lead Door. Usually in Qi Men literature, the
terms Envoy and Envoy Door mean the same thing.
For instance, if Earth Plate Lead Stem is at the Xun Palace ,
then the Envoy for this Chart will be the door of Delusion (Refer
to the Basic Natal Chart of the 8 Doors). In this case, the Envoy is the Door
of Delusion.

G: Plot the 8 Deities
There are a total of 8 Deities in Qi Men Dun Jia. These are Chief 44, Snake
Z, Moon FÉ, Harmony 4, Hook Phoenix 'E, Earth Heaven k. The
leader of these 8 Deities is called — The Lead Star (Zhi Fu fifi).
You will notice that the term Lead Star is previously used to describe the
'Leading' Star of the 9 Stars stream. It is in fact referring to the SAME
thing. Thus plotting the 8 Deities is merely a simple continuation from the 9
Stars.
Step 1:
First locate the Chief This is extremely easy to find. The location of the
Chief is found in the location of the Lead Star.
Step 2:
After you have located the Chief arrange the rest of the 8 Deities
following the Clockwise Cycle. Please take note that the ORDER of the 8
Deities arrangement will go either the Forward flow, if it is Yang Structure, or
the Reverse flow, if it is Yin Structure.
