put all the details in timelines that is neatly organized on when and what is going to happen and what actions to take and what is the best crypto to puchase during those times


Here’s a clean, easy-to-follow **timeline and action plan** based on your text — organized by **month and phase**, with clear guidance and strategic notes (without “bet-the-farm” risk-taking).

***

## 📆 **Crypto Market Timeline & Action Plan (Late 2025 – 2026)**

### **September 2025 — Research & Accumulation**

**Market status:**

- Bitcoin around **$111,000** and nearing end of its dominant phase.
- Bittensor (TAO) trading near **$300**, identified as a long-term, high-potential but higher-risk play.

**Action:**

- Begin research accumulation: BTC (steady core) + early positioning in select altcoins.
- **Best purchase candidates:**
    - **Bitcoin (BTC):** safer, lower-risk long-term hold.
    - **Bittensor (TAO):** speculative, long-term potential (7-year outlook).
- Diversify; avoid over-allocation to any single coin.

***

### **October 2025 — Bitcoin’s Last Big Spotlight**

**Market trend:**

- Bitcoin likely makes final strong moves before attention shifts to altcoins.
- Altcoin rotation begins quietly underneath.

**Action:**

- **Trim partial profits** from Bitcoin strength.
- **Rotate small allocations** into quality altcoins showing early strength.
- Stay alert for BTC topping signals.

**Focus coins:**

- BTC (reduce slightly, keep as base),
- ETH (liquidity magnet),
- TAO and a few strong AI- or infra-related projects.

***

### **November 2025 — “Altcoins Will Shine” Phase Begins**

**Market trend:**

- Altcoin rally starts taking center stage.
- Capital rotates from BTC into alternative sectors (AI, L2s, DeFi, infrastructure).

**Action:**

- Increase exposure to **top-performing altcoins** (momentum + fundamentals).
- Consider staggered buying over the month — market likely volatile but upward.
- Track narratives (AI, decentralized compute, real-world assets).

**Focus coins:**

- TAO (Bittensor) — AI network narrative.
- ETH — base for DeFi revival.
- SOL, AVAX, RNDR — high-velocity alt performers.

***

### **December 2025 → January 2026 — Crescendo & Plateau**

**Market trend:**

- Major **market peak / euphoric phase** expected sometime between **late Dec 2025 – Feb 2026**.
- Extreme volatility; some coins will double or triple rapidly, then fade.

**Action:**

- **Take substantial profits** as momentum peaks.
- Avoid chasing pumps.
- Rotate into stable assets (USDC, BTC partial rebuy) to protect gains.
- Expect correction / consolidation soon after.

***

### **February – March 2026 — Correction & “Last Bounce”**

**Market trend:**

- Sharp correction and short-term consolidation.
- A final smaller bounce gives **last opportunity for selective altcoins** to shine before the cycle ends.

**Action:**

- Avoid panic-selling at first correction; wait for **rebound to take final profits**.
- **Do not re-enter aggressively** — this is the tail end of the cycle.
- Reposition for long-term holdings (BTC, ETH) or stablecoins.

***

### **Mid-2026 — Cycle Completion & Reset**

**Market trend:**

- Post-peak decline and cooling period.
- Time to reassess and prepare for next multi-year accumulation phase.

**Action:**

- Re-enter only after market stabilizes.
- Begin accumulation again once macro indicators reset (bear-market lows, new narratives).

***

## ⚖️ **Portfolio Strategy Summary**

| Timeframe | Market Focus | Suggested Action | Coin Focus |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Sep 2025 | Accumulation | Research, early buys | BTC, TAO |
| Oct 2025 | BTC peak forming | Trim BTC, rotate small into alts | BTC, ETH, TAO |
| Nov 2025 | Altcoin season begins | Add positions, ride momentum | ETH, TAO, SOL, RNDR |

***

### ⚠️ **Reminders**

- **Don’t over-leverage or “bet the farm.”** Use position sizing and gradual scaling.
- **Probabilities, not certainties:** timing windows can shift by 1–2 months either direction.
- **Lock in profits:** don’t let greed erase gains.
- **Diversify by narrative:** AI (TAO), Smart Contracts (ETH/SOL), Compute (RNDR), Base store of value (BTC).

# 📆 CRYPTO STAGE TIMELINE & ACTION PLAN (2025–2032)

***

## 🧭 OVERVIEW OF THE STAGES

| **Stage** | **Focus** | **Risk Level** | **Goal** | **Core Assets** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Stage 1** | US Dollars (cash-out phase) | 🔹 Low | Secure profits, avoid drawdowns | USD, USDC |
| **Stage 2** | Bitcoin accumulation | 🔹 Low–Medium | Build foundation for next run | BTC |
| **Stage 3** | Large Cap Altcoins | ⚪ Medium | Outperform BTC moderately | ETH, SOL, ADA, AVAX |

***

# 🗓️ **DETAILED TIMELINE — 2025 TO 2026**

***

### **📍Q4 2025 — The Climax Stage (Currently in Stage 3 → 4 Transition)**

**Market Outlook:**

- Bitcoin: strong run possibly toward **$130K–$140K** range.
- Total Crypto Market Cap: **$5T–$5.9T**, key threshold to watch.
- Altcoins are accelerating rapidly (“Stage 4”) as enthusiasm peaks.

**Signals to Watch:**

1. Are we running hot and overly confident?
2. Has BTC reached $130K–$140K?
3. Has total market cap reached $5T–$5.9T?
4. Is the **MVRV-Z score above 7** (possible spike to 9.8)?

**Action Plan:**

- Begin preparing to **rotate profits into USD (Stage 1)**.
- Do *not* wait until exact peak — sell in **layers** as metrics trigger.
- Lock in enough profit to have strong liquidity for 2026.
- **Top cryptos for this window:**
    - **BTC:** primary profit-taker (core holding).
    - **ETH:** follows BTC momentum.
    - **TAO:** speculative long-term (AI theme).
    - **SOL / RNDR / AVAX:** final surge candidates.

***

### **📍Jan–Feb 2026 — Plateau & Peak Zone**

**Market Outlook:**

- Crypto reaches a plateau or euphoric high (“gift anomaly” possible).
- Extreme volatility — fast swings, last leg of current bull run.
- Altcoins may retrace after peaking.

**Action Plan:**

- **Exit remaining altcoins** as targets are met.
- **Hold majority in US Dollars / USDC (Stage 1).**
- Accept that timing isn’t perfect — focus on capital preservation.
- Monitor “gift anomaly” rally but stay cautious.

**Key Reminder:**
When you start answering “yes” to any of the 4 market signals → **begin exiting**.

***

### **📍Mar–May 2026 — The Correction & Bounce**

**Market Outlook:**

- First deep correction following the plateau.
- Quick bounce/retrace (last chance for profit-taking).
- Market begins trending down overall.

**Action Plan:**

- **Sell the bounce** → return to **Stage 1 (USD)** fully.
- Do **not chase rebounds** — they’re deceptive.
- Sit in cash; let market bottom form.

***

### **📍Mid–Late 2026 — Reset & Bitcoin Reaccumulation**

**Market Outlook:**

- Bitcoin corrects into **$70K range**.
- Altcoins drop further, many losing 70–90%.
- Market sentiment: disbelief, boredom, fear.

**Action Plan:**

- Begin **Stage 2 (Bitcoin Accumulation)** slowly:
    - Start **DCA into BTC** weekly/monthly.
    - Avoid jumping into altcoins yet.
- Build position gradually through late 2026–early 2027.

**Best Buy Focus:**

- **Bitcoin (BTC):** foundation for next 7-year growth.
- **ETH:** optional second core for diversification.

# 📈 LONG-TERM STRATEGY — 2026 TO 2032

| **Period** | **Market Condition** | **Stage** | **Action** | **Goal / Focus Coins** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **2026–2027** | Bear Market Bottom | Stage 2 | DCA into BTC, accumulate quality | BTC, ETH |
| **2027–2028** | Early Recovery | Stage 3 | Add Large Caps | ETH, SOL, AVAX |
| **2028–2030** | Mid-Bull Market | Stage 4 | Add select small caps (AI, DeFi, compute) | TAO, RNDR, niche leaders |
| **2030–2032** | Expansion → Next Peak | Stage 1 | Sell into USD as new top forms | USD, USDC |

***

# ⚖️ RISK VS REWARD FRAMEWORK

| **Portfolio Mix** | **Description** | **Expected Return (7 Years)** | **Risk Level** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| USD + BTC only | Low-volatility, defensive | \~5–10x | 🟢 Low |
| USD + BTC + Large Caps | Balanced | \~20x | 🟡 Medium |
| USD + BTC + Large + Small Caps | Aggressive | \~50–100x | 🔴 High |

***

# 🧠 KEY TAKEAWAYS

- **Current Position (Q4 2025):** We are in Stage 3 → 4. Prepare for exits soon.
- **Main Goal:** Move to cash as targets hit → wait for next bear market reentry.
- **Next Cycle Opportunity:** Bitcoin near $70K in 2026 = prime re-accumulation zone.
- **7-Year Outlook:** Trend upward overall; volatility is opportunity, not danger.
- **Discipline beats timing:** focus on stages, not perfect tops or bottoms.

***
 
Here’s a **clean, timeline-style summary and action plan** based on that section — written for clarity, organization, and practical crypto strategy alignment.

***

## 🗓️ Bitcoin Price Target & Strategy Timeline (Late 2025–2026)

### **Phase 1: Now → Q1 2026**

**Market Context:**
We are still in a strong uptrend (Stage 3–4). Bitcoin is moving toward its major target zone.

**Actions:**

- 🎯 **Set Sell Targets:**
    - Primary target: **$130K–$140K**
    - Stretch target (“gift” scenario): **up to $150K**
    - Extreme unlikely high: **$184K** (only if a rare anomaly plays out)
- 📈 **Plan to Take Profit:**
    - Begin scaling out of Bitcoin as it enters the $130K–$140K range.
    - Don’t wait for the top — focus on *reasonable* exit points that allow time to execute calmly.
- 💬 **Mindset Reminder:**
    - Timing tops perfectly is impossible.
    - Stick to the pre-defined exit range rather than reacting emotionally.

***

### **Phase 2: Q2–Q4 2026**

**Market Context:**
After the plateau/peak, expect a correction and retrace — possibly down into the $70K–$80K range.

**Actions:**

- 💵 **Sit in US Dollars (Stage 1)** once profit is locked in.
- ⏳ **Wait for Pullback:**
    - Watch for Bitcoin to dip below $80K.
    - Start monitoring closely as it breaks **$79K** — that’s the “very interested” zone.
- 💰 **Re-entry Plan:**
    - Begin reaccumulation in the **$70K–$80K** range (Stage 2).
    - Use **DCA (Dollar Cost Averaging)** to spread out re-entry and minimize timing risk.

***

### **Phase 3: Late 2026–2027**

**Market Context:**
Bitcoin stabilizes post-correction. This will likely form the base for the next long-term bull phase.

**Actions:**

- 🧭 **Reallocate to Bitcoin first**, not altcoins.
- 🌱 **Once Bitcoin stabilizes**, evaluate top-tier altcoins for the next cycle (Stage 3).
- 🧘‍♂️ **Stay patient and strategic** — allow market sentiment to reset.

***

***

## 📈 **Market Mechanics Summary**

| Theme | Insight | Takeaway |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Sequence of Movement** | Bitcoin first → Large caps → Altcoins later | Don’t rush into alts too early. Follow the “old man first” rule. |
| **Timing Uncertainty** | Cycles are changing — dates shift | **Timing ≠ strategy**. Focus on structure, not exact days. |
| **Government & ETF Influence** | U.S. policy and ETF delays can affect timing | Treat policy shifts as catalysts, not roadblocks. |
| **Plateau ≠ Crash** | Plateau is a pause, not a total reversal | Expect consolidation and correction afterward, not collapse. |
| **Cycles Are Evolving** | Old 4-year patterns are breaking | Expect new rhythm — shorter corrections, longer expansions. |

***

## 🧭 **Strategic Investor Actions**

| Phase | Core Actions | Emotional Discipline |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Before November 2025** | Accumulate BTC, ETH, BNB | Stay patient — avoid timing anxiety. |
| **November 2025 – January 2026** | Rotate into alts as BTC momentum slows | Don’t chase hype; take profits gradually. |
| **January 2026 Plateau** | Take profit into USD | Stick to plan — no fear of “missing the top.” |
| **Spring 2026 Correction** | Sit in USD; re-enter BTC around $70K–$80K | Trust process — wait for reset. |
| **Late 2026+** | Begin next 7-year accumulation | Think long-term — “forget the peaks.” |

***

## 🪞 **Mindset Summary**

- Forget “Peak 1, 2, 3” — timing is noise.
- Focus on **targets, not dates.**
- The biggest gains (50–80% of total cycle growth) come **at the very end of the bull cycle** — and we’re **entering that zone now.**
- Success = sticking to a rational exit plan, then reloading calmly during correction.

***
 
Yes — it **makes sense overall**, but it’s **very repetitive**. The writer keeps circling back to the same core ideas with slightly different wording. Here’s the breakdown so you can see clearly:

***

### 🧭 **Core Message**

The text is explaining the **crypto market cycle**, focusing on:

1. **Bitcoin moves first**, then **large-cap coins (ETH, BNB, etc.)**,
and **altcoins** follow later (around **November**).
2. A **market plateau or peak is expected around January 2025**,
followed by a **correction**.
3. **Don’t obsess over timing** — focus on the long-term upward trend.
4. **Three peaks** or phases in this larger market cycle were predicted;
we’re somewhere between **peak two and three**.
5. **Political and macro factors** (e.g., Trump, ETFs, government delays)
might align with market shifts, but timing can be off.
6. **The big takeaway**: the bull market isn’t over — there’s still **“more gas in the tank.”**

***

### 🔁 **Repetitions / Redundant Sections**

The main repetitions:

- “Bitcoin moves first, then large-cap, then altcoins” — repeated several times.
- “Timing doesn’t matter / ignore short-term timing” — emphasized throughout.
- “Plateau or peak around January” — mentioned in multiple ways.
- “I’ve been right, just sometimes off on timing” — restated a few times.
- “We predicted this in earlier reports” — repeated references to past accuracy.
- “Don’t worry about whether we’re in peak 2 or 3” — same message multiple times.

***

### 💡 **Condensed Core Summary (2 sentences)**

The crypto cycle is unfolding as expected: Bitcoin and major coins lead first, with altcoins gaining strength around November. A likely plateau or temporary peak may come around January 2025, but timing is less important than staying positioned for the longer bull run, which still has significant upside ahead.

***
 
Yes — I can absolutely turn this into a **clean, clear timeline** that summarizes all the predictions, expected events, timing windows, and recommended crypto actions.

Here’s how it looks when condensed into a **strategic “Crypto 7-Year Roadmap”** (based directly on your material).

***

## 🪙 **Crypto 7-Year Roadmap (2025 – 2032)**

*(Based on TIA Belle’s projections and spirit guidance)*

***

### **Phase 1 — 2025: Major Bull Run & First Sell Window**

**Timing:** Q4 2025 (most likely period for “plateau” or temporary peak)
**Market Context:** Bitcoin and large-cap coins (ETH, BNB, XRP, SOL, ADA, LINK, DOGE) lead the charge; altcoins surge later in the year (around Nov).

**Key Actions:**

- **SELL ZONE:** BTC ≈ $130 K – $140 K (target ≈ $135 K)
- **Total Crypto Market Cap:** ≈ $5 T – $6 T
- **Strategy:** Begin staged selling
    - Sell 30 % at 65 % of target
    - Sell 30 % at 75 % of target
    - Sell 30 % at 85 % of target
    - Hold 10 % “just-in-case” bag

**Why:** Cycle culmination and first major plateau expected around Jan 2025 (± 1 month).
**Note:** Timing may shift; focus on structure, not precision.

***

### **Phase 2 — 2026: Major Correction & Re-Entry Zone**

**Timing:** Late 2026 (likely Q4)
**Market Context:** 40 – 50 % pullback across major assets after 2025 peak.

**Key Actions:**

- **BUY ZONE:** BTC ≈ $75 K (± 10 %)
- **Altcoins:** Watch top 10 and strong mid-caps (LINK, SOL, PYTH, SUI, TAO, ASI, ONDO).
- **Cycle Note:** Accumulation phase; emotional patience needed.

***

### **Phase 3 — 2027 → 2028: New Highs & Second Major Sell Window**

**Timing:** Main run-up through 2027 – 2028; monitor closely during 2027.

**Key Actions:**

- **SELL ZONE:** BTC ≈ $455 K (± 10 %)
- **Market Cap:** ≈ $15 T – $20 T
- **Watch for:** Significant “revamp” or reset across major projects within 5 years (Quantum computing / global finance shift).

***

### **Phase 4 — 2029 → 2031: Uncertain / Outlier Period**

**Timing:** Unknown – “spirit did not give target.”
**Market Context:** Could see unusually deep correction or milder decline than expected.

**Key Actions:**

- Stay flexible; treat this as an **outlier window**.
- Reassess fundamentals of projects being “revamped.”
- Build liquidity and monitor regulatory changes.

***

### **Phase 5 — 2032 ≈ Final Peak / Ultimate Sell Window**

**Timing:** Around 2032 (± a year)
**Market Context:** Maturity phase of current macro cycle.

**Key Actions:**

- **SELL ZONE:** BTC ≈ $2 M (± 10 %)
- **Market Cap:** ≈ $80 T (± 10 %)
- **Hold vs Sell:** Decide if you’ll exit fully or retain a long-term bag.
- **Theme:** Completion of 7-year cycle.

***

## ⚙️ **Supplementary Factors to Monitor**

| Category | 2025-2027 Impact |
| --- | --- |
| **Politics** | Trump administration expected to reform USD structure (treasury, bond market). Weaker dollar & mild inflation could benefit crypto. |
| **Regulation** | New SEC leadership leans pro-crypto; expect rapid approvals and market clarity vs past delays. |
| **Technology** | Quantum computing and global finance revamp may force blockchain project upgrades within 5 years. |

***

## 🧩 **Recommended Portfolio Framework**

| Tier | Focus | Examples |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Core Holdings (Low Risk)** | Primary Layer 1s & majors | BTC, ETH, XRP, ADA |
| **Mid-Cap Opportunities** | Emerging Layer 1s & AI/Oracle plays | LINK, SUI, PYTH, SOL, TAO, ASI, ONDO |
| **High-Risk “Lottery Tickets”** | Speculative small caps | WELL, GUNZ, XPRT |
| **Thematic Diversification** | RWA, AI, Gaming, DeFi | Allocate small percentages for exposure |

***

### **Summary of Actions**

| Year | Action | BTC Target Zone | Overall Crypto Cap | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **2025** | SELL Phase 1 | $130 K – $140 K | $5 T – $6 T | Q4 2025 peak → plateau Jan 2026 |
| **2026** | BUY Phase 1 | $75 K (± 10 %) | — | Re-accumulate late 2026 |
| **2028** | SELL Phase 2 | $455 K (± 10 %) | $15 T – $20 T | Second major peak |
| **2029-2031** | Hold / Observe | — | — | Outlier period – unclear direction |
| **2032** | SELL Phase 3 (Final) | $2 M (± 10 %) | ≈ $80 T | Long-term exit window |

Perfect — here’s a **clean, easy-to-read timeline outline** (no tables, just narrative flow).
It keeps everything from your source material, but reformats it into a flowing 2025–2032 roadmap — with clear events, coin focus, and actions.

***

# 🪙 Bitcoin & Crypto 7-Year Timeline (2025–2032)

***

### **Phase 1 — Setup and Early Climb (Late 2024 → Early 2025)**

- **Event:** First major wave of the next bull run begins.
- **Bitcoin:** Pushes toward **$100K–$130K**.
- **Altcoins:** Large-caps like **ETH, XRP, BNB, ADA, LINK** begin to follow.
- **Market cap:** Roughly **$5–6 trillion**.
- **Action:**
    - Hold existing positions.
    - Prepare staged sell targets around **$130K BTC**.
- **Tone:** Confidence builds as regulation turns friendlier (e.g., post-Trump policy shift).

***

### **Phase 2 — First Peak & Partial Exit (Mid to Late 2025)**

- **Event:** **First major top / “Plateau Zone.”**
- **Bitcoin target:** **$130K–$140K** (most probable: $135K).
- **Altcoins:** Catch up shortly after Bitcoin tops.
- **Action:**
    - **Sell gradually in stages:**
        - 30% near 65% of target
        - 30% near 75%
        - 30% near 85%
        - 10% kept as a “moon bag”
- **Context:** “Timing most variable” — short-term swings possible.

***

### **Phase 3 — Major Correction & Buy Zone (Late 2026)**

- **Event:** Broad market correction and re-accumulation period.
- **Bitcoin:** Drops to roughly **$75K ±10%**.
- **Altcoins:** Decline sharply — deep discounts across sectors.
- **Action:**
    - **Buy / accumulate**: BTC, ETH, ADA, LINK, SOL, TAO, SUI, PYTH, ONDO, ASI.
    - Build positions patiently; avoid panic.
- **Tone:** “Testing conviction.” Market reset to shake weak hands.

***

    - LINK → \~$1,300
- **Action:**
    - **Sell** large portions into strength during this phase.
    - Keep small long-term core positions.
- **Context:** “Crypto Revamp” era — many major coins upgrade protocols or merge with AI / Quantum / RWA themes.

***

### **Phase 5 — Uncertain / “Outlier” Period (2028–2029)**

- **Event:** Market becomes unpredictable — potential sideways movement or unexpected drop.
- **Bitcoin:** No clear target given.
- **Action:**
    - Stay flexible.
    - Hold cash and core coins.
    - Wait for clarity before re-entering new plays.
- **Tone:** “Unknown timing — expect a twist.” Financial system changes may be unfolding.

***

- **Event:** Final and largest parabolic run of the decade.
- **Bitcoin target:** **≈ $2 Million ± 10%** per BTC.
- **Altcoins:** Explosive parabolic phase — AI, Oracle, and Gaming coins outperform.
- **Action:**
    - **Sell / Take profits heavily** through 2031–2032.
    - Consider retaining a symbolic “legacy” portion.
- **Tone:** Culmination of the 7-year plan — wealth transfer and closing of the cycle.

***

## 🧭 Core Investing Principles from the Message

1. **Timing is flexible — structure is key.** Expect slight shifts in each phase.
2. **Bitcoin leads, altcoins follow** (usually 1–2 months later).
3. **Buy fear / sell euphoria.**
4. **Revamp cycle (2027–2028)** could redefine which projects survive.
5. **Never “bet the farm” on one coin — even altcoin favorites are fluid.**
6. **Ultimate destination:** Bitcoin at roughly **$2 M by 2032**; total crypto market around **$80 T**.

***

Here’s a **clean, simplified summary and timeline** of all that material — structured into a 7-year outlook (2025–2032) with key **coins, expectations, and action steps**.
This keeps the main predictions but removes repetition and side stories.

#### **5. Chainlink (LINK)**

- Still strong and relevant in 5–7 years.
- Long-term price target: **≈ $1,300**.
- Needs **token utility upgrades** to force LINK use for payments/services.
- Action: Hold; monitor for network upgrades and tokenomics changes.

#### **6. XRP (Ripple)**

- Price range in near term: **$5 → $20**, possibly more before 2028.
- “Current format” of XRP likely **gone within 7 years** (replaced or rebranded).
- Action: Trade it for profits during this cycle; do not hold for long-term legacy.

#### **7. Theta (THETA)**

- “On the fence” for long-term survival.
- Still has a near-term run but uncertain 5–7 years out.
- Action: Ride short-term pump, then exit and rotate back into Bitcoin during corrections.

#### **8. Astar (ASTR)**

- Near-term potential: **$4–$8 range**, possibly up to $20 but not likely.
- Already had big gains; treat as shorter-term trade.
- Action: Take profits early; be wary of overextension.

#### **9. Hyperliquid**

- Smaller-cap but strong play this cycle.
- “Make money and get out” type trade.
- Action: Use for short-term gains; not a long-term hold.

#### **10. “Smoking Chicken Fish” (novelty/meme coin)**

- Might have a **fun, meme-like comeback**, possibly **30x** to \~$0.09.
- Action: Treat as speculation only; do not overallocate.

# 📈 Crypto Investment Guide: Timelines, Targets & Action Plan

### 📊 Market Overview (As of Fall 2025)

The current market cycle is \*\*not over\*\*. The most probable outcome is continued upside for both Bitcoin and altcoins before the next major correction. Even in a worst-case crash, a strong floor is expected for Bitcoin in the \*\*$70,000s\*\*, followed by a quick recovery. The market is now heavily influenced by institutional and political forces, which can accelerate timelines unexpectedly.

---

### 🎯 Bitcoin (BTC) Price Targets & Timeline

| Timeframe | Event | Target Price | Action Items |

| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

| \*\*Fall 2025\*\* | New Cycle Peak | \*\*$130,000 - $150,000\*\* | \*\*HOLD.\*\* Wait for the market to get "toppy." Do not sell yet. |

| \*\*Early 2026\*\* | Cycle Top | Plateau/Peak | \*\*SELL.\*\* Take profits when the market feels overheated. Don't try to time the exact top. |

| \*\*2026 - 2027\*\* | Correction / Bottom | \*\*$70,000 - $79,000\*\* | \*\*BUY.\*\* This is the key accumulation zone. Start DCA in the $80,000s. The bottom will be quick. |

| \*\*2027 or Earlier\*\*| Key Resistance | \*\*$185,000\*\* | \*\*BE AWARE.\*\* A pullback is expected at this level. The timing is uncertain. |

| \*\*Late 2028\*\* | Next Cycle Peak | \*\*\~$500,000\*\* | \*\*HOLD.\*\* This is the target for the cycle following the 2028 halving. |

| \*\*By 2032\*\* | Long-Term Peak | \*\*$2,000,000\*\* | \*\*HOLD.\*\* This is the ultimate long-term target (\~18x from the current $110K price). |

### 💰 Altcoin Strategy: The Path to 20x+ Gains

The "Bitcoin Only" strategy is suboptimal for those seeking life-changing wealth. While safer, it misses the explosive 20x-100x returns that altcoins can provide. A balanced altcoin strategy is the "golden ticket."

#### Recommended Altcoin Portfolio Structure

\*   \*\*Core:\*\* A few Top 10 coins.

\*   \*\*Growth:\*\* A few Top 50 coins.

\*   \*\*Speculative:\*\* A couple of solid coins ranked 50-120.

\*   \*\*Lottery Tickets:\*\* One or two pure gambles outside the Top 200.

#### Crypto Watchlist & Tiers

| Tier | Coins | Strategy & Potential |

| :--- | :--- | :--- |

| \*\*Top-Tier Performers\*\* | \*\*SOL\*\*, \*\*XRP\*\*, \*\*SUI\*\*, \*\*PYTH\*\*, \*\*ONDO\*\*, \*\*LINK\*\* | These have already crushed Bitcoin this cycle and will continue to be strong. |

| \*\*Next Cycle Stars\*\* | \*\*ETH\*\*, \*\*LINK\*\*, \*\*XRP\*\*, \*\*SOL\*\*, \*\*TAO\*\*, \*\*SUI\*\*, \*\*ADA\*\* | Highest probability coins to recover and shine in the next bull run (2027-2028). |

| \*\*High-Risk / Lottery\*\* | \*\*XPRT\*\*, \*\*WELL\*\*, \*\*GRASS\*\*, \*\*GUNZ\*\* | \*\*High-risk.\*\* Potential for a "crazy run" but be prepared for them to go to zero. |

| \*\*"50x in 5 Years" Portfolio\*\* | \*\*SUI\*\*, \*\*TAO\*\*, \*\*GUNZ\*\*, \*\*GRASS\*\* | A curated high-risk, high-reward portfolio expected to significantly outperform Bitcoin. |

---

### ✅ Action Timeline & Strategy

1.  \*\*NOW (Fall 2025): HOLD.\*\*

    \*   \*\*Action:\*\* Do nothing. Wait for the final leg up of this cycle. Bitcoin is heading to \*\*$130K-$150K\*\*.

2.  \*\*THE PEAK (Early 2026): SELL.\*\*

    \*   \*\*Action:\*\* When the market gets "toppy," start taking profits. Convert gains to USD or stablecoins.

3.  \*\*THE BOTTOM (2026-2027): BUY.\*\*

    \*   \*\*Action:\*\* When Bitcoin enters the \*\*$70,000s\*\*, begin aggressively accumulating. This window will be short.

4.  \*\*THE NEXT CYCLE (2027-2028): RIDE.\*\*

    \*   \*\*Action:\*\* Hold your positions from the bottom. Ride the wave towards the \*\*$500K\*\* Bitcoin target.

5.  \*\*THE LONG GAME (2028-2032): PATIENCE.\*\*

    \*   \*\*Action:\*\* Hold core positions for the ultimate \*\*$2M\*\* Bitcoin target.

---

### ⚠️ Risks & Warnings

\*   \*\*#1 Near-Term Risk: LEVERAGE.\*\* This will fuel the bear market. \*\*DO NOT USE LEVERAGE.\*\*

\*   \*\*Political & Economic Factors:\*\* A weakening dollar under Trump could drive crypto prices higher. Market manipulation is now a major factor that can accelerate timelines.

\*   \*\*Custody:\*\* Services like \*\*Caleb and Brown\*\* are considered safe for the next year. Re-evaluate in 2027, as a potential issue was noted "within two years." Do not move funds unnecessarily at this late stage of the cycle.

\*   \*\*The Window is Closing:\*\* The opportunity for these massive returns will diminish over the next 5-7 years as the asset class matures.

---

### 💡 Strategic Principles: Do's and Don'ts

#### \*\*DO:\*\*

\*   ✅ Sell when the market is "toppy," not at the exact top.

\*   ✅ Buy the \*\*$70,000s\*\* bottom aggressively.

\*   ✅ Use a balanced portfolio of Bitcoin and high-potential altcoins.

\*   ✅ Hold altcoins for at least one year for tax advantages.

\*   ✅ Stay calm during corrections; the market has a bright future.

#### \*\*DON'T:\*\*

\*   ❌ \*\*DO NOT USE LEVERAGE.\*\*

\*   ❌ Don't try to time exact tops or bottoms.

\*   ❌ Don't go "full degen" or YOLO into high-risk plays.

\*   ❌ Don't get stuck on a "Bitcoin Only" strategy if you are seeking massive gains.

\*   ❌ Don't panic sell. Corrections are part of the process.

### 📋 Final Checklist

#### For the Peak (2025-2026):

- [ ] Have your exit strategy ready.

- [ ] Know which coins you will sell and at what price points.

- [ ] Prepare for the emotional difficulty of selling in a euphoric market.

#### For the Bottom (2026-2027):

- [ ] Have cash reserves ready to deploy.

- [ ] Set your target buy levels (e.g., start DCA at \*\*$85,000\*\* for BTC).

- [ ] Create your altcoin shopping list (\*\*ETH, LINK, SOL, TAO, SUI\*\*).

#### For the Long-Term (2027-2032):

- [ ] Be mentally prepared to hold through volatility.

- [ ] Keep an eye on key resistance levels (\*\*$185K\*\*) and major targets (\*\*$500K\*\*, \*\*$2M\*\*).

- [ ] Stay flexible; the old 4-year cycle theory is becoming obsolete.

If you want, I can also **convert this into a visual roadmap with a timeline, price markers, and altcoin rotation zones** so it’s instantly digestible at a glance.

Do you want me to create that visual roadmap?

## 🌍 **2026 & Beyond — Simplified Summary**

### **Core Message**

Crypto cycles have changed. The old *Bitcoin halving model* no longer works.
Instead, think in **4 repeating Stages**:

1. 💵 **Stage 1 – US Dollars (cash)**
2. 🟠 **Stage 2 – Bitcoin**
3. 🟣 **Stage 3 – Undervalued large-cap altcoins**
4. 🔵 **Stage 4 – Smaller altcoins (high risk, high reward)**
Then back to Stage 1 — and repeat.

***

### **Where We Are Now (as of Sept 2025)**

➡️ Currently in **Stage 3 (large caps)**
➡️ Moving toward **Stage 4 (altcoins)**

**Q4 2025 Outlook:**

- Market expected to rise strongly.
- **November:** Altcoins begin to outperform.
- **Around January (±):** Likely market *plateau/peak* — time to **take profits**.
- **After correction:** Bitcoin may fall toward **$70K** → re-enter via **DCA (dollar-cost averaging).**

***

### **Key Price Targets & Signals**

- 🎯 **Bitcoin near-term goal:** $130K–$140K (ideal profit zone).
- 📉 **Buy-back zone:** \~$70K.
- 💰 **Total crypto market cap to watch:** $5T–$5.9T.
- 📊 **Indicator:** High MVRV-Z score (>7) = overheated market.
- 🔹 Example speculative pick: **TAO** — very high potential, very high risk.

***

### **Strategy & Risk Management**

✅ **Do:**

- Diversify across stages (don’t “bet the farm”).
- Set clear sell targets **before** the peak.
- Hold profits in USD during corrections.
- Re-enter Bitcoin at lower levels via DCA.
- Be patient — “things go slow until they don’t.”

🚫 **Don’t:**

- Use leverage.
- Store large amounts in stablecoins long-term.
- Trade emotionally or chase every move.

***

### **Risk by Stage**

| Stage | Asset Type | Risk | Reward |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | USD | Very low | None |
| 2 | Bitcoin | Low | Steady |
| 3 | Large-cap altcoins | Moderate | High |
| 4 | Small altcoins | Very high | Very high |

***

### **Macro Drivers**

**Headwinds (can slow markets):**

- Fed tightening / high rates
- Excess leverage & stablecoin risks
- Global political/economic tensions

**Tailwinds (can boost markets):**

- Fed easing / more liquidity
- Regulatory clarity (e.g., ETFs, new laws)
- “Anomaly” catalysts (unexpected bullish events)

***

### **Action Checklist**

1. Read the full report calmly.
2. Wait **24 hours** before changing strategy.
3. Define your **sell** and **buy-back** levels.
4. Avoid leverage & risky collateral loans.
5. Match exposure to your risk tolerance (Stages 1–4).
6. Monitor key signals: BTC price bands, total market cap, MVRV-Z, and Fed policy.

***

### **Quick One-Line Summary**

> “Crypto cycles have shifted — follow the 4-Stage model (USD → BTC → Large Caps → Altcoins), take profits near \~$130K–$140K BTC, then re-enter on the dip (\~$70K). Long-term trend remains strong; success depends on discipline, patience, and risk control.”

***

Here’s a clear, simple summary of that long Bitcoin section — easy to understand and focused on the key takeaways:

***

### 🔹 **Main Message: Bitcoin to $2 Million by 2032**

- The author claims a strong “spiritual message” that Bitcoin will reach **$2 million per coin within 7 years (by 2032)**.
- They emphasize the number “2” repeatedly as confirmation and call it a “cornerstone message.”

***

### 🔹 **What to Expect Before Then**

- A **sudden major Bitcoin price surge** is predicted soon — possibly within months — where the price “goes crazy” for a short time before dropping back down.
- The author warns: **Don’t panic when it drops**. The spike is meant to *show* where things will go long term.

***

### 🔹 **Predicted Prices by 2032 (Top 6 Coins)**

| Coin | 2032 Target | Growth from Sep 2025 | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Bitcoin (BTC)** | $2,000,000 | 20× | Lowest risk |
| **Ethereum (ETH)** | $110,000 | 22× | Solid pick |
| **Solana (SOL)** | $8,000 | 38× | High growth |
| **Cardano (ADA)** | $35 | 43× | Higher risk |
| **Chainlink (LINK)** | $1,300 | 61× | Needs “modifications” |
| **XRP** | TBD | — | Under review |

**Other long-term picks:** TAO, SUI, and GUNZ.

**Note:** Predictions get less reliable the further out they go. Don’t “bet the farm” on any single coin.

***

### 🔹 **“CASH DAY IS COMING” (Short-Term Message)**

- A near-term event (weeks or months) where cash or liquidity becomes critical.
- Delays or setbacks are framed as spiritual “tests of faith.”
- The message encourages patience, positivity, and resilience — don’t get negative or fearful.

***

### 🔹 **Trump and the “Crypto Buttons”**

- “Buttons” symbolize **major political or policy events** that could cause crypto market surges.
- The author claims Trump is the main driver of upcoming crypto changes.
- Another “button push” (market catalyst) is expected between **October and November**, possibly tied to regulations or ETF approvals.

***

### 🔹 **Cycle Changes & Higher Future Targets**

- Traditional 4-year crypto cycles may not hold.
- Some price targets might **exceed expectations** or **take longer** to reach.
- 2026 may be a “cool period” (slow market), followed by a new growth phase.

***

### 🔹 **Mindset & Behavior**

- Stay **humble and discreet** if you profit — avoid bragging or saying “I told you so.”
- Be **graceful and private** about gains for safety and maturity.
- Keep faith, patience, kindness, and positivity — these are your “arrows in the quiver.”

***

### 🟢 **Bottom Line Summary**

- Bitcoin: possible path to **$2 million by 2032**.
- Expect **volatile ups and downs**, including sudden spikes and drops.
- Other coins may rise strongly too, but riskier.
- 2026 may bring a **temporary cooldown**, followed by renewed momentum.
- Focus on long-term conviction, emotional balance, and keeping a positive mindset.

***
 
Here’s a **clear, easy-to-read summary** of that long 2026 section — focused on the main ideas, timing, and strategy while keeping the tone consistent with the original message.

***

## 🔹 **Theme for Crypto in 2026: “Foundation”**

- **Keyword:** “Foundation” — 2026 is about **building a strong base** for the long-term crypto ecosystem.
- **Meaning:** The market will consolidate and stabilize after explosive growth, forming a solid base for the next cycle.
- **Shift in Power:**
    - Crypto begins to act as its **own global currency**, not controlled by traditional systems.
    - Under Trump, U.S. policy becomes more open to crypto — moving away from the era of SEC crackdowns.
    - “They lost control, but Trump wants that.” → Governments can’t dominate currency the way they once did.

***

## 🔹 **Market Flow & Timing Overview**

| Period | Key Event / Phase | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Nov 2024 – Jan 2025** | “Old Man” coins lead (BTC, ETH, XRP, ADA, SOL, LINK, etc.) | Altcoin season follows soon after |
| **Jan 2025 (± 1 month)** | **Crypto Plateau** | Market stalls or peaks; brief correction expected |
| **Mid–Late 2025** | Renewed growth → **Bitcoin to $130K–$140K** | “Sell zone” #1 |
| **Late 2026** | Pullback → **Bitcoin around $75K** | “Buy zone” |
| **2027–2028** | Strong rally → **Bitcoin around $455K** | “Sell zone” #2 |
| **2032** | **Final Target: $2M per BTC** | May arrive earlier or later depending on conditions |

> ⚠️ *Timing is variable. The report stresses not to obsess over exact dates — focus on long-term direction.*

***

## 🔹 **The “Plateau Around January”**

- “Plateau” = when the market **peaks and flattens** before a correction.
- Expected **around January 2025** (plus or minus one month).
- Sequence:
    1. Bitcoin rises first →
    2. Top 10 (“Old Man”) coins follow →
    3. Then smaller altcoins surge later (around November).
- **Lesson:** Don’t panic about short-term tops or dips — the bigger trend is still upward.

***

## 🔹 **Mindset Guidance**

- **Stop chasing perfect timing.**
The author emphasizes letting go of “peak” obsession — predicting every top and bottom causes stress and mistakes.
- **Focus on strategy:**
    - Set sell targets ahead of time.
    - Use a structured approach (sell 30% at 65% of target, another 30% at 75%, another 30% at 85%, hold 10% “just in case”).
- **Accept imperfection:**
“Nobody times the top or bottom perfectly — just build a plan you can live with.”

***

## 🔹 **Major Bitcoin Price Targets**

| Type | Target | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Sell #1 (2025)** | $130K–$140K | 8× from the 2022 low |
| **Buy (2026)** | $75K (±10%) | \~40–50% correction |
| **Sell #2 (2028)** | $455K (±10%) | \~6× from 2026 low |
| **Buy (Unknown period)** | TBD | Possible unexpected dip |
| **Sell or Hold (2032)** | **$2,000,000** | Market cap near $80T |

> 💡 The phrase “timing will change” appears repeatedly — meaning price zones matter more than calendar dates.

***

## 🔹 **“Revamp Within 5 Years” Vision**

- Within **5 years**, many major projects will be **revamped or rebuilt**.
- This could relate to:
    - **Quantum computing**,
    - **Global financial restructuring**, or
    - **Regulatory changes**.
- “It will all work out” — a message of reassurance and long-term faith in crypto’s survival.

***

## 🔹 **7-Year Outline (High-Level Plan)**

| Phase | Years | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **$$ Out** | 2025–2026 | Take profits |
| **BTC Buy-In** | 2026–2027 | Accumulate |
| **Altcoin Buys** | 2027–2028 | Selective entries |
| **$$ Out Again** | 2028 | Possibly as early as 2027 |
| **Final BTC Buy** | After correction | Hold long term |

***

## 🔹 **Political & Economic Changes Impacting Crypto**

- A **new SEC leadership** (aligned with Republicans) accelerates approvals and reduces hostility toward crypto.
- **Trump’s economic shift:**
    - Plans to **restructure the U.S. dollar**, **Treasury**, and **bond market**.
    - Could partially **back the dollar with gold or assets**, bringing gold prices near **$6,000**.
    - Aims for moderate inflation and a “weaker but stronger-backed” dollar — bullish for crypto.

***

## 🔹 **Layer-1 Forecast (5–7 Years)**

| Project | Long-Term Outlook |
| --- | --- |
| **Ethereum (ETH)** | Remains dominant |
| **Solana (SOL)** | Strong but may be overtaken |
| **Sui (SUI)** | Predicted to rise sharply — potential #2 position |
| **New Entrants** | Expected to emerge and compete later |

***

## 🟢 **Bottom Line Summary**

- **2026 = Foundation Year** → consolidation, rebuilding, and preparation for the next major crypto expansion.
- **Don’t chase timing;** hold a structured strategy with clear sell targets.
- **Plateau expected around January** with growth resuming later.
- **Long-term outlook (2025–2032):** Bitcoin possibly reaching **$2M**; altcoins follow their own multi-year rhythm.
- **Spirit message:** “Stay grounded, patient, and consistent — the real gains come to those who build on the foundation.”

Here’s a clear, easy-to-read summary of your notes on specific crypto projects and overall strategy:

***

### **Long-Term Crypto Predictions (2025–2032+)**

**1. Bittensor (TAO)**

- $50,000 possible in \~7 years.
- Could double to $100,000 long-term, but focus on $50K as realistic.
- High probability for significant growth.

**2. SUI**

- Still around in 7 years.

- Needs adjustments for wider adoption (LINK-based payments).

**4. XRP (Ripple)**

- Current XRP may not exist in 7 years; could be replaced by a new token.
- Short-to-medium-term: $5 → $8–$9, potentially $20.
- Long-term: “Stepford version” may continue, but original XRP likely phased out.
- Strategy: play one step at a time, expect more short-term runs.

**5. Theta Network (THETA)**

- Status uncertain long-term; coin is on the fence.
- Likely short-term gains, then strategic pause in Bitcoin.

**6. Aster**

- Current target \~$2.12; could double.
- Moderate risk, smaller market cap, potential 4x returns.

**7. Hyperliquid**

- Safer choice for this cycle compared to Aster.
- Good for short-term strategic gains.

**8. Smoking Chicken Fish**

- Hysterical, niche project with potential 30x spike (\~$0.09).
- More novelty than mainstream investment.

***

### **Preferred Long-Term Portfolio**

- **Bonus:** Include some **DOGE**; possible short-term surge to $2+.

***

### **Potential “Low-Hanging Fruit” Coins for Bear Market Monitoring**

- BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL, ADA, LINK, SUI, HBAR, WLF, NEAR, APT, TAO, ONDO, RENDER, SEI, FET, INJ, PYTH
- Watch for “panic selling” or oversold zones for recovery potential.

***

### **Key Anomalies & Alerts**

1. **Market Cap Targets**: $5T (\~2025) & $15T (later, next cycle). Could hit sooner if unexpected “gift” occurs (\~2026).
2. **Target Changes**: Prices may reset higher than predicted; flexibility needed.
3. **Bitcoin $184–185K**: Potential resistance or spike; monitor closely.
4. **Next Cycle Timing**: Bitcoin Halving in 2028; market could spike earlier (2027), breaking old 4-year cycle assumptions.

**Core Strategy Reminder:**

- Do **not** focus on precise timing.
- Follow trends, take profits at strategic points, and adjust as new opportunities arise.
- Flexibility and risk management are key for multi-year crypto strategy.

***
 
Here’s a **simplified, easy-to-read summary** of your crypto plan:

***

## **Crypto Plan Summary (2025–2032)**

### **1. Selling Strategy**

- Sell when the market feels “toppy” — signals of overheating, not necessarily the absolute top.
- Short squeezes can temporarily push prices higher but usually don’t last.

### **2. Buying Strategy**

- Bitcoin bottom likely in the **$70K–$80K range** — start buying (DCA) there.
- Altcoins mostly bottom around **2027**, but some may recover earlier.

### **3. Key Altcoins to Watch**

- **High probability for growth:** ETH, LINK, XRP (or its new version), SOL, TAO, SUI, ADA (pending confirmation).
- **Speculative plays:** XPRT, WELL, GRASS, GUNZ — high upside, high risk.
- Stick with **Top 10–50 coins** for safer bets, a few mid-tier coins, and one or two “lottery” coins.

### **4. Bitcoin Targets**

- **2025:** $130K–$140K (could exceed $150K).
- **2026–2027:** $180K–$185K.
- **2028:** $500K potential.
- **Before 2032:** $2M potential.

### **5. Market Philosophy**

- Crypto is **psychological warfare** — focus on long-term, don’t obsess over daily fluctuations.
- A few strong projects held for 4–5 years can lead to **100x+ gains**.
- Avoid falling for “paradigm shift” or “up only” hype — corrections are necessary.

### **6. Bitcoin vs Altcoin Strategy**

- **Bitcoin-only:** Safe for wealth preservation, less chance for massive gains.
- **Altcoin strategy:** Riskier but offers higher potential (10–50x) returns within a cycle.
- Balance is key: combine Bitcoin with selected altcoins.

### **7. Near-Term Risks**

- **Leverage** is the biggest short-term threat — avoid it.
- Other factors: Fed, Supreme Court rulings, European markets, political shifts.

### **8. Long-Term Outlook**

- Bitcoin and top altcoins will **remain stable and grow** over years.
- Crypto is a long-term opportunity — focus on asymmetric bets (high return, manageable risk).
- Spot ETFs and secure platforms (like Caleb and Brown) are safer than self-custody for most.

### **9. Takeaways**

- Don’t panic over short-term drops — opportunities to buy will arise.
- Stick with your plan, be patient, and focus on the **next several years**.
- Big gains come from **holding strong altcoins + Bitcoin** and playing the long-term cycle.

Check on the “Bitcoin Bottom” in

2026/2027, one more time!

The team feels this is so important that they need to approach this multiple times in

separate sessions. I don’t generally recall exactly what I have shared in prior sessions

so I’m okay with this process.

Bottom for Bitcoin after this cycle?

Bitcoin gets up to its, whatever it gets up to this year, whether it's 135, 140, 145, 150,

then we know it's going to pull back.

My sense is Bitcoin should pull back to somewhere in the 70,000s at some point in what

feels like 2026. Does that feel too low or too high? Could it go into the low 60,000s? Or

high $60,000s? I heard 7, so I will go with $70,000s. Yes, and they (spirit) said it's

only going to be a short period of when it bottoms, not long, not a long time

down there. That’s important. Fair warning.

You'll get that opportunity in 2026 or early 2027. Now the only thing is, though, if you

look at the market once a month, you’ll miss that best buying opportunity. So, you’ll

need to stay dialed in or you're likely going to miss it. I feel you could detach in previous

bear market phases, but not this next one. And if you don't check the markets regularly,

you won’t be able to jump on it. Or, you guys should stay dialed in and the team just

said “also set some “limit buy orders”, not financial advice.”

If you're slow to the game, and again using the game format, that's when it's going to be

problematic because it's going to be, they (spirit) just said a very, very short window to

buy Bitcoin.

Listen, 100%, they (spirit) just showed me a seven to start buying and I am not getting

that out of my head. So I would start buying at $79,000 and DCA (dollar cost average)

in from that point all the way to a bottom. I don’t know the exact bottom.

Ethereum?

Over the past couple of years, they (spirit) would always give us a “four” when we

checked on Ethereum. I decided to go with $14,000 as an approximate target for this

cycle or not long after.

So here’s what I feel about Ethereum. It is not one of the best projects, but it has the

most money in it and it will go higher in time and I feel we're looking at the $14,000

range more towards our next plateau at either the end of this cycle or it may not be until

later. I don’t feel I know for certain. At least we know that even if it doesn’t hit the

higher targets this cycle, it’s going to have more runs over the next years and that’s

more than we can say for a lot of other coins. I mean, I see it can go to $110K or more

when Bitcoin hits $2M. $110,000 in the long term? Yeah, of course, why not. It will be

overtaken by something not currently out yet though. I think I have told you about this

before.

For this year (plus or minus a little time), the next stop we can look for is in the eight to

nine realm ($8K to $9K), that’s what I'm hearing. The 14 definitely comes in time just

maybe more towards the beyond 2025 range, but we’ll see soon enough.

When we get in the next big ETH push in the next years, it will go into the $20,000s. So

ETH $20,000s is very real and it isn’t many many years away. Shoot, ETH $110,000 is

very possible.

Here’s what’s crazy, you already know this if you’ve read this report from top to bottom,

I can see ETH has a shot of cresting the $100,000 ($110K) mark in the longer term.

Obviously if Bitcoin reaches the $2M they (spirit) showed me, of course the projects that

survive will come along for the ride. ETH has the chance to be one of those! It’s old

and slow, but not down and out for the count yet. That being said, it eventually gets

replaced.

I have never been the biggest fan of ETH for this current cycle, but always felt it would

be stable and do well. Do I feel it will be one of the best performers in the future? Well,

the best? No, but pretty good. Bottom line, crypto will become so big it almost

becomes like the game “survivor.” It’ll (ETH) survive long enough to see some big gains.

The Resurgence of Meme Coins!

Don’t count meme coins out! As stupid as you may think meme coins are, they will

have a big run.

Meme coins are not dead. Some of the meme coins we’ve talked about and identified

early will have a major resurgence.

I feel we've got a huge sector of meme coins that are going to come out. For some

reason, that's going to be the “Vidal Sassoon jeans” of the crypto market. You know, in

style and all the rage for a time.

DOGE! Keep an eye on Doge!

Where will you keep your profits after

selling? What’s your top Stable Coin

preference?

US Dollars in my bank and some US Dollars at Caleb and Brown and Uptrade.au

That’s it, period.

Top stable coin preference. You aren’t listening to me. We’ve talked about this a dozen

times over the past couple of years. Stable coins for quick moves, okay, I get it for

convenience or for those who are forced to, but once we hit a bear market, you probably

don’t fully appreciate the risk. These are not risk free like some think.

I have not used any stable coin and I don’t plan to. Anyone who has an account with

Caleb and Brown and/or Uptrade.au does not need to use stable coins because you

can hold US Dollars with them. I think you can even hold US Dollars with Coinbase,

check into that. Bottom line, any money I plan to get back into the market will be stored

in US Dollars.

I’m sorry, I know, I know some people want me to say Tether or USDC or RLUSD are

all great and perfect, but no, I don’t feel that way. Our friends who keep asking, it just

2025/2026 Copyright TIA BELLE and Team – do not copy, post or reprint Page 48 of 116

feels like people don’t understand how everything works and they just want someone to

promise them there’s no risk. There is risk.

There’s risk with everything and more with stable coins then people have figured out. I

do not endorse any stable coin in the near term and those who decide to use them for

mid to long term storage need to take responsibility for their decisions. Stable coins

just don’t feel full proof for now, even with the Stable Coin Act that recently passed.

Liquidity crunches can have short term implications, I don’t know how all of this works, I

just know I see risk with stable coins. That’s all I’m saying. I know history doesn’t

always repeat, but it often rhymes so didn’t you guys see this movie play out before?

Didn’t you see something blow up with FTX and then that started a cascade of

liquidations which quickly spread to places you might not have even thought possible? I

don’t know, but I know how I feel about all of this right now. No to stable coins for

storing wealth, for me. You do what you need or what you like and I’ll always pray it all

works out. I want nothing but the best for you.

Crypto Captial Gains, Rule Changes?

What’s Trump trying to do with capital gains? Because they (spirit) are in my head and

showing me… what is he (Trump) trying to do with capital gains, Trump? People have

given up on this, but Trump is still trying to lower capital gains tax on something to do

with crypto. This is related to crypto. This idea and push is not dead. It’s just that there

are things which need to be implemented first as he’s trying to do it in a way, it’s related

to “legality-wise.”

Trump has to do it in a solid, legal, long standing way before he can start manipulating

numbers and that's what people need to understand, things need to be done in lock

step.

Could Trump do an executive order? Maybe, but it would be challenged and reversed

in time.

Each step is important to implementing the bigger plan. We are in the first steps before

we hit certain things. So it feels more probable somewhere in the next years, 2026 or a

little later. In the not too distant future, Trump will roll out his crypto capital gains

changes and it will fire up the crypto market once again.

And there's going to be something that changes with how quickly you can make money.

So they're (spirit) telling me that the people like you and our group, who have had this

knowledge and who have been in the game from the time when people thought it was a

complete fallacy, will be so far ahead that in the future the opportunity is gone. It's

2025/2026 Copyright TIA BELLE and Team – do not copy, post or reprint Page 49 of 116

going to be very difficult after you start going to that four hundred thousand dollar range

to actually, you're not going to be able to play the same way of getting in the game, it’ll

already have done the life changing moves. I mean, when Bitcoin has bottomed and

then runs up to that $400K, what’s left? A 5 X? Does that change anyone’s life?

There will be two diversified groups of people. One is going to be comprised of the

people who have had crypto and built and taken profits and built again OR who just held

on to crypto from the early days. AND then you will have the people who come in late

and have to pay up and the game is way trickier.

It’s about two groups of people. The early crypto people and the later crypto people.

It's almost like a nice little piece of prime real estate. It's like you bought the piece of

property because you knew a good piece of property before the majority realized the

area was going to be developed. So you bought that property at $10,000. And then

once it became a star, everybody else came in and now they're paying $1M. So it's like

that for the late bloomers who come to crypto.

Market Structure Bill?

The market structure bill (Clarity Act) gets signed in the law before the end of the year,

don’t worry about that. They showed me Holidays. So maybe that’s Thanksgiving or

Christmas, but it’s this year and it’s coming. Worse case, beginning of 2026. Just know

that type of big news can mark a peak for a time though.

More Altcoin Spot ETFs?

More altcoin spot ETFs. Soon. I feel like I’ve been saying that for a while. It’s soon,

within a month or two. Getting through November without the altcoin spot ETFs in place?

No, I don’t feel that way, at all.

2025/2026 Copyright TIA BELLE and Team – do not copy, post or reprint Page 50 of 116

Buying right now, in Sep and Oct of

2025?

Short answer, YES! Last chance for many large cap altcoins.

Longer answer, it depends when you’re reading this and which crypto you’re buying. In

general, yes, you should be purchasing some of them, if you want to buy (not Bitcoin),

now's a time to do it. Now is a time to do it, but it’s crypto so you need to have a game

plan and if you aren’t nimble you can expect to watch it run up quick and then come

down again. The team always tells me that anytime they buy there’s almost always a

correction. They say it makes them chuckle.

Bottom line, buying now is, generally speaking, your last chance because it really

doesn’t matter when you’re in this stage of the market -- right now corrections recover

fairly quickly and the market goes higher.

I always tell my friends, “Crypto, don’t miss it, but have a 5 to 7 year time horizen. And

if you buy it now in Sep or Oct, generally speaking, better sell half of it if it does a quick

2 X because then you’re playing with free money and you can relax a little bit.”

The ironic part about all of this that we've represented in a very bizarre way is all of the

new coins and the meme coins that come out, it’s still the old man coins that are going

to be your winners for a time, you know, like your bars of gold. That being said, we

have a window coming up where the other altcoins will rock and roll. Remember, for

months I’ve been sharing NOVEMBER for the idea of “altcoin season,” but obviously

you need to build in a little wiggle room when I give “timing” predictions like that. What if

it’s December because of the whole “Government shutdown” nonsense? Just know it’s

coming.

So there will be lots of new coins and the meme coins will have there time, but the

legitimate coins are the long term bets and playing the game now is to your advantage.

The game's going to change and in five years, that game is going to change and be

more complex with the gains, generally speaking, becoming smaller and smaller. Five

years from now, we’re just not getting the big time gains in this game.

Crypto has been and still is a rare opportunity for the average person to make

substantial gains. “Class changing” gains.

Crypto, generally speaking, has been a gift to those who paid attention, took moderate

risk, and put in the time to learn.

2025/2026 Copyright TIA BELLE and Team – do not copy, post or reprint Page 51 of 116

The overwhelming, the feeling of overwhelming opportunity is intense. I just think, for

people who are impatient or people that don't have belief, you’ll miss a once in a lifetime

opportunity if you don’t cool your jets and make this work for yourself.

Listen, how I feel about this, while working right now and listening to spirit, the

overwhelming feeling of what will come is staggering.

You all know, for years, I had been waiting for Trump to come in for this. I'd been

waiting for him to kick the SEC to the curb. I had been waiting for all of this and all his

people working behind the scenes, his helpers, to be in place and marching forward. I

have been waiting for this period we’re in. Take advantage!

Peak 2, Peak 3? Is there a Peak 4?

Oh my God. Stop with the Peak 2 and 3 questions. Any talk of “peak 2” or “peak 3” at

this point is moot.

All that matters is you have sell targets set and you execute whenever they may hit.

I’ve always very clearly shared that people would not be able to buy and sell the

bottoms and tops of the early “peaks.” It’s always been about hitting some goals and

“final check out” points.

Of course you’re going to ask an obvious question, “after this next run up hits its’ top,

will we have another one?” Fair enough. Yes, there will be many more over the next

seven years, but the trick is hitting some of this “cycles” targets and getting some

money out of the game and then getting some back in when Bitcoin works its’ way back

down into the $70,000s. Don’t worry, you don’t need to be perfect.

Try to let go of the timing questions. Just set your sell targets and let go of everything

else for now. Fear is a liar. The unknown equals fear. You know enough to not be

fearful, you just need a little faith and patience and to let things play out.

All you can do at this point is set your reasonable sell targets and wait until they

hit OR you see the market has multiple “top indicators” flashing red! That’s it.

That’s the game. That’s your edge. You’ll win some, you ‘ll lose some and then

you’ll move on.

From this day forward, any talk of “peak one, two or three” or “when” is a mistake and a

distraction. The 3 peaks we talked about in last years’ annual report were vital as

“knowing” about them gave many the conviction that the “cycle” had lots of time and

room to grow. Whether you argued we were on peak 1 or 2 over the past 11 months

2025/2026 Copyright TIA BELLE and Team – do not copy, post or reprint Page 52 of 116

didn’t matter because you knew we would have at least one more peak. And you know

that’s also true today as we speak. That alone just might be worth a million dollars.

Knowing we had more peaks coming this year just may have been the thing that gave

enough people the confidence to hold on. I feel that especially holds true right now!

You know you have a minimum of one big peak remaining and that provides you with

enough airspeed and altitude to assess where you stand today and prepare for when

this market gets heated up and we approach the January time frame. The team says

that has been priceless to them, but you get to decide what everything means to you.

This journey is difficult, I’m just the messenger and hope I have helped in some small

way to get you to this point because I feel strongly things are ready to massively change

in your favor.

My plan, said another way…

Okay, I get it you want to cover the most important things multiple times. I don’t want to

hear from anyone “oh, there were a couple of sections that were repetitive.” Obviously!

Let it go, bro. The team didn’t want to edit any messages or nuance from spirit related

to key questions. Either don’t read this next section or deal with the little bit of repetition,

capiche. I mean, all you have to do is read it, I got grilled over and over to make sure

we didn’t miss anything. You know what, I already know we’re going to give some new

info. They (spirit) just said that. Okay, let’s do it.

You know how to communicate successfully when you feel something is important. Say

it once, say it twice and when you think you’ve said it too many times, say it again!

One more time, here’s what I’m doing. You do whatever feels best for you. We all have

different goals and ideas:

 When things get overheated in the next months sell 90% or more of all crypto and

go to US Dollars, not stable coins. You decide where to keep your money safe. I

will use a combination of a credit union with no major exposure to commercial real

estate and a major US Bank with relatively small exposure to commercial real estate

and is “too big to fail” and I will leave some US Dollars with Caleb and Brown and

Uptrade.au. You do whatever you want. That is on you. This is what I’m doing and

I do not care what anyone else is doing. Nobody HAS TO use stable coins if they

can get an account at caleb and brown, uptrade.au or coinbase (as long as you live

in a state supported). If there’s some reason and/or you insist on using stable coins,

then probably usdc, tether or rlusd. If I was forced to use stable coins, I would split

my risk over a few of them and put some money in usdc, tether and rlusd. They all

feel about the same and I don’t love any of them for the next year or so. See, the

2025/2026 Copyright TIA BELLE and Team – do not copy, post or reprint Page 53 of 116

team just said you got a little more info on your stable coin question I didn’t give

before!

 When Bitcoin breaks below $80,000 I will begin buying Bitcoin in chunks and keep

doing this until Bitcoin has bottomed and has started its’ accent up and breaks

above $90,000. I plan to be done buying around $90,000. If Bitcoin makes it down

to $71,000 great, if it only makes it to $77,000, fine. If Bitcoin drops into the

$60,000s, great, I’ll make sure I have money on the side. If Bitcoin drops into the

$50,000s, great, I’ll deploy more “dry powder” as you say. If Bitcoin drops down into

the $40,000s, I’ll mortgage my house, just kidding, but I will buy more. I know in the

future Bitcoin will be around $2M.

 After buying BItcion, waiting for top alts to form individual bottoms and Dollar Cost

Averaging in is my next move. I will be closely following LINK, XRP, SOL, ETH, SUI,

ADA, TAO, PYTH, ONDO and others.

 In 2027 I will start building out my “sell targets” for the altcoins I feel most compelled

to buy. I think it’s important to have some idea of where you think a coin can

reasonably go before you buy it. I can see there will be many new coins we may

want to consider, coins we haven’t talked about yet.

 When our next cycle gets “toppy” I will start scaling out of Bitcoin and it feels like

around $400K - $500K, potentially in late 2028 or early 2029. Not long after I start

scaling out of Bitcoin I will start scaling out of altcoins.

 I will sit and wait, keeping all profits in US Dollars. I didn’t get a time frame or price

target for this next “buying maneuver” after the local peak in the $400Ks to $500K

range, so at this point I’m loosely looking at when Bitcoin drops under $300,000 in

2029’ish? At whatever price I end up feeling is right, I will start buying “Bitcoin only”

and then do nothing until I see Bitcoin reach over $1.5M in 2031- 2032. I may not

sell much at that point as it’s game over, the big volatility is gone and we have the

Stock Market 2.0 in place. This is when you can finally more safely borrow

against your Bitcoin (not before then as the volatility is too high and people

will get liquidated and forced to sell their collateral). Too many people think

borrowing against Bitcoin is the right play right now, but I feel it is far too

dangerous to do before we reach the $1M threshold. Please, take this to heart

and really study this. Fair warning! I see danger on borrowing against your crypto

2025/2026 Copyright TIA BELLE and Team – do not copy, post or reprint Page 54 of 116

assets before we cross the $1M threshold and even then you should expect big

volatility. Maybe best not to borrow against Bitcoin until it goes a fair bit past $1M.

Shameless “When Moon” Question!

Jupiter and cancer alignment, it

begins on October 18th, and it runs

through December 5th. Do you feel

like that might coincide with your

“cash day” is coming, prediction?

I just got a message from them (spirit) that period, that's running very high and powerful,

and it is working in a very positive way. Did you know that’s not always the case.

Sometimes when the planets align it's not all positive. Great news, for this, as you just

asked about it, they're (spirit) saying that they're feeling this is going to run in a very

positive way.

Astrology becomes something which years ago people used to do, like Trump. I worked

with a woman who was THE astrologer for the Trump family. She did all of the

astrology for all of the Trump family, and it was delivered on Christmas Eve each year.

So Trump was very big into astrology and back in the day you had to sit and do them

and they were very time-consuming. Now everything's computerized.

Interviewer. That's cool. I think, like anything, Tia, anything in the best

hands, the people who are the best in the world at astrology, it can be very

useful. I think in the wrong hands it's useless.

Agreed.

Coin Reviews and Targets!

Tia’s Portfolio

Note: While not listed here, I hold a little Bitcoin which I purchased back in late

2022 when we first started this group. I also hold a little Theta.

For all of the coins listed below, these are the coins I picked up over the years and

while I might not put together the same portfolio if starting from scratch today,I don’t

get rid of a coin after adding it to my portfolio until a target has been met or I feel it’s

time to let it go.

In short, if someone was starting from scratch today, they probably shouldn’t just

copy my portfolio. Instead, it might be smarter to go through all of the coins and

targets and pick a couple of large caps, mid caps and then one or two lottery bets

that might do a 50 X or go to zero. It’s about building a balanced risk/reward

portfolio spread over a few main categories (Layer-1, AI, RWA etc.) based on your

personal goals. Someone looking to get a 10 X in the next several months doesn’t

have the luxury of picking up the lowest risk coins like BTC, ETH, XRP, SOL etc as

they don’t have as much room to run “this cycle.” Just remember, generally

speaking, anything outside of the Top 100 carries huge risk.

TO BE CLEAR, you should make all necessary updates to the “Price” and

“Potential” category as needed. Some will have already changed by the time you’re

reading this!

Rank Token Price (Oct. 7) target potential

5 XRP\*^ $2.86 $5, $8-$9 2.7-3.1 X

Tia’s message from spirit on 8 October 2025 follows: XRP. You're hitting that five

first. It's going to go to five first and then it will hit eight. It's going to have two jumps.

8 DOGE\* $0.25 $0.70, then $2 2.8, 8 X

2025/2026 Copyright TIA BELLE and Team – do not copy, post or reprint Page 56 of 116

Tia’s message from spirit on 8 October 2025 follows: DOGE. You're going to get

your targets, all of them and when you go into the second period, you're going to see

the two dollar range. When is the second period? They (spirit) said the ground will be

frozen in the second period. They're either going to give it to me or not. I can't force it,

but this time they (spirit) gave me everything. The numbers and the timing. Hold on.

They’re (spirit) saying something. What's going on with DOGE? Our friends need to

make sure that they buy it, they need to make sure that they buy a little bit. Just tell our

people that they need to make sure that they buy it, and then when that flys and rings

our target, when that bell rings on that you take your money out.

10 ADA\*^ $0.82 $6s 7.2 X+

Tia’s message from spirit on 8 October 2025 follows: Cardano is going to double

first, so it’ll go into the $1.50 to $2 range first. It's very favorable, people gravitate to it.

So that's going to show you some doubling in the nearer term. I don't know if you had

that projected? Some gap after that double to the next move. So from the doubling

there's going to be a little gap to the second move up, you're going to get a nice hit, a

move up to around that $6 range.

14 SUI\*^ $3.45 $16, then $18-$20 4.6, 5.7 X

Tia’s message from spirit on 8 October 2025 follows: Sui. That just has some

serious rocket fuel on it. I can't explain it, but it's got rocket fuel on it. I feel you're going

to get to your second targets pretty quickly and then we can reevaluate to see how

much gas is left in the tank. I would do the trajectory higher on the first target range you

have and then revisit to see if there’s more for the second target range. It's just... I mean

people, if you have it, God bless you because there's something with this coin, I don't

know what it is, but it's got some rocket fuel. If you want to spend a little bit more before

it takes off, I would purchase it.

It's weird, I can remember that coin coming up when I lived in the old house, when it

was brand new and I said wait a bit, it’ll drop and we have time to scoop it up. That’s

what it did and we got it when it was much lower. Here’s the good news, it’s still a good

price and you can still buy it.

38 TAO\* $332 $5000-$6000 15-18 X

Tia’s message from spirit on 8 October 2025 follows: Bittensor Tao. Keep your

target the same, but just know it can go way past that in the future. Tao's going to be

like a SUI type of coin. Total winner, rocket fuel. Tao's going to be another SUI type of

success story. I'm trying to figure out the word they’re (spirit) telling me right now,

almost like this is... People don’t understand this and it actually leads it to have this

2025/2026 Copyright TIA BELLE and Team – do not copy, post or reprint Page 57 of 116

crazy momentum, if that makes sense. People don't really understand it, but due to that,

it is making people so intrigued by it. It's like a la boo boo.

Interviewer: Right. It's one of the first open marketplaces for AI. If it works,

they're going to be a successful open marketplace for decentralized AI

apps, which is a mouthful, but to your point, it's a big deal.

Yeah, that's what I'm getting, is that people don't even know why they like it.

41 ONDO\*^ $0.91 $3, $6, then $12-$14 3.5, 6.5, 15.3 X

Tia’s message from spirit on 8 October 2025 follows: You going to three first. Then

you'll get your six and then we revisit it from there because Ondo could stall out, Ondo

could do a jump to 3, 6 and then a stall until the next run up.

46 ICP\* $4.44 $60-$70, then $80 13.5, 18 X

Tia’s message from spirit on 8 October 2025 follows: ICP. You could just keep that

as a yes to your targets and that distance between the sixty and the eighty will be

quicker than you think.

59 SEI\*^ $0.29 $5s 17.4 X

Tia’s message from spirit on 8 October 2025 follows: SEI. Yes, the five range is a

good target and I don't know if that's going to pursue much after. I don't know if that's

going to stay around in that range for long. This is one we will need to take a close look

at to see what happens after. What I want you to do is I want you to look at that coin

when it hits around 4, that needs to be revisited as to whether we're going to see more.

This is good, but I don't know if they can have the duration up there.

60 RENDER\*^ $3.38 high $50's, $75 17.1 X. 22 X

Tia’s message from spirit on 8 October 2025 follows: Render. The fifties are fine

and it even has a great chance of getting up to 75.

2025/2026 Copyright TIA BELLE and Team – do not copy, post or reprint Page 58 of 116

68 JUP\*^ $0.44 $5, <$11 11 X, < 24.7 X

Tia’s message from spirit on 8 October 2025 follows: JUP. Yeah, you're going to

go in your first jump, they’re showing me a hard five. In the next move up, yes, we can

get to a little under 11.

72 ASI (FET)\* $0.56 $11 19.6 X

Tia’s message from spirit on 8 October 2025 follows: ASI. You're getting 11.

85 AERO\* $1.09 $5, then $9 - $10 4.5, 8.25+ X

Tia’s message from spirit on 8 October 2025 follows: AERO. 5, then 9 to 10. This

one, is going to be a really hard hitter, fast once it really starts going, like good.

89 PYTH\* $0.16 high $3's 25.2 X

Tia’s message from spirit on 8 October 2025 follows: PYTH. We're looking for

something in the high threes, $3 range. That's easy. We need to revisit that after though,

in the future, because I just want to know and make a note of this, they're (spirit) making

me feel like I can see it where I'm at now, but they're not showing me longevity on that,

so I want to make sure that I'm showing you what I'm seeing and that needs to be

revisited. While this has big potential for this “cycle” I don’t know if this is a multi year

big winner. Does that make sense to you?

Interviewer: Yes. Many projects are big in one cycle and then fade. We’ll

check on it down the road. We plan to be almost completely out of it if it

hits our targets so no worries, no stress. We will have time to reevaluate

all of these to see if we want to get back in at some point in the future. For

what it’s worth, if PYTH keeps plugging, they have a shot of picking up

market share from LINK, but we’ll see.

92 SONIC\* $0.30 $4+ 13.3 X+

Tia’s message from spirit on 8 October 2025 follows: SONIC. You're good with the

four plus a little.

2025/2026 Copyright TIA BELLE and Team – do not copy, post or reprint Page 59 of 116

100 WIF\* $0.74 $16-$17 21.6-22.9 X

Tia’s message from spirit on 8 October 2025 follows: WIF. 16 to $17 range and

then that's going to die. Probably smart to get out under that target. When that bell rings,

be done with it. Literally, if you hold on to that, we warned you.

153 SUPER\*^ $0.58 $5, $11 8.6 X, 18.9 X

Tia’s message from spirit on 8 October 2025 follows: Super. Yeah, you're going

to five first and then the 11 range.

178 AKT\* $1.01 $10, $20, <$30 10 - 20 X, <29.7 X

go, your installments go to 10 and then 20 and then maybe 30.

245 MINA\*^ $0.16 $5, later on $11 30.4 X

Tia’s message from spirit on 8 October 2025 follows: MINA. 5, we can leave it there.

There’s a strong chance this becomes a long term play and off in the future you may get

to 11 on that. They (spirit) said that's going to be a slow steady coin, so that's one to

have in your possession as long as you're patient with it. It doesn't need to be a mover

because it has long range projection. That's what they (spirit) said. This one is more of

a long term type of bet so factor that in if it is something that’s important to you.

508 Arcblock\*^ $0.64 $4, $20 6.25 X, 31 X

Tia’s message from spirit on 8 October 2025 follows: Arcblok. Yeah, you get a

break after the first move, so that's going to be weird they (spirit) said, it's going to give

you like $4 and then your four is going to seem like it's insignificant, and it's going to be

weird because it'll do four and then it'll make quite a leap in its’ next run. So that's going

to be very weird in the perspective of a little bit and then a lot.

1427 XPRT\* $0.028 $1.20, high $2s, maybe $9+ 43, 90, 320 X+

Tia’s message from spirit on 8 October 2025 follows: XPRT. Yeah, to 1.20 as a

key target. There’s a chance for more, but you know this is a lottery ticket. The

numbers are all over the place on this. This really is a hero or a zero. Fair warning.

Interviewer: It's one of our wild card bets. It's been one of the ones that

you've been like, "Listen, it's a lottery ticket, it's hero or zero, you might win

a shit ton on it or you might lose everything on it. It is what it is." It has

done nothing but go down. It's a high risk bet, but it's a fun little bet. It

feels so wrong to me, it’s probably right.

Tia’s message from spirit on 8 October 2025 follows: Bitcoin. Keep our long

standing target. You're going to wake up in the morning coming up soon in the next

month, and it’s just going to be one day that it's just going to accelerate crazy and you're

going to be like, "Holy shit, today's the day, I just got my coffee. What the heck am I

seeing right now? Bitcoin went nuts." It's going to have just this massive growth spurt,

and it's going to be a day, and then it's going to drop down again, but it's just

everybody's got to watch the craziness that's coming up with the numbers, or I want to

put it this way, they (spirit) said, "You're going to watch things that you can't explain. It's

just going to be like one day, you get up with a cup of coffee and look and you are

shocked. Like how the f is Bitcoin at this level?" That day is almost here, and it's all

indicative of understanding that you're being shown where things will go in the future.

Here’s the other part of the message. Don't become a crybaby about it when it drops

after.

You're going to get that day and that's what they're (spirit) telling me and then it goes

down, but they (spirit) said to make sure you understand it. Don't get like a crybaby, oh,

it went up all the way today and then it plummeted back to normalcy because that's

where it's going to go. So they (spirit) are showing you.

2 ETH $4,477 $8-$9k, then $14000 1.7, 3.1 X

Tia’s message from spirit on 8 October 2025 follows: Ethereum. Keep our targets

the same as we’ve had them. They (spirit) showed me that four again.

Interviewer: Funny. You don't even know, this is so crazy. You would

never know this, but literally, you get that four for Ethereum so frequently,

T, and I'm always like, "Is that 4,000 or is it 14,000?" You were getting the

four back when Ethereum was just over a thousand and you're like, "It

feels higher than 4,000, let's call it 14," and now it's past 4,000 and you're

like, "I'm going to go with 8 and 9, then 14,000."

Well at least this is the only steady thing in my life. It's a dead guy who keeps coming

through for Ethereum, at least we're steady together. Everything else has its moments.

Tia’s message from spirit on 8 October 2025 follows: Monero. Why are they (spirit)

showing me something illegal about that coin. Maybe they will make it illegal?

Interviewer: There may be. You would never know this. It's a privacy

coin. The transactions can't be traced, so money launderers, people trying

to tax evade, you would never... Holy shit, you are on it. Yes T, bam. Yes,

you are right, but that's one of the attractive things about it because it can't

be censored. So while illegal activity no doubt occurs with it, freedom is

what it’s primarily about for the average Joe.

We don't care and it's out of the country. That is not in the United States. That is out of

the United States. When I tell you the most, you could pick the craziest weird place, like

Denmark, it's so off the beaten path of crypto, but yes, it's illegal for some of what it is

being used for.

2025/2026 Copyright TIA BELLE and Team – do not copy, post or reprint Page 63 of 116

Interviewer: It is deemed illegal by some “authorities,” but because of that,

because they can't track it... Say someone came after you some day, the

government just decided one day, "Oh we don’t like Tia so we’re going to

freeze her bank accounts and take her money." With this, they can never

get to it, they can never touch it, they never can see it. Nobody even

knows about it. So there is, people who are legal even like that about it.

But it's going to continue to be a popular coin. Yeah, and I think we're going to exceed

that $1,400 target and you're going to need to keep your eye on the prize on this one

because it’s a case of, he who gets the last laugh. People laughed at this, but it has legs.

Interviewer: Yeah, I mean well said. It's so funny, you would never know

this. There's another one that's exactly... You know how there are multiple

coins that do the same type of thing, they kind of compete. There's

another one that's like Monero, it's called ZCash and out of nowhere just a

few days ago, ZCash just rocketed up, like what the heck? And it just shot

up. It's the same type of thing. Crazy, you would never know that.

45 POL $0.24 $2.20, $5 9.2X, 20.8 X

Tia’s message from spirit on 8 October 2025 follows: Polygon is going to go up to

five, Polygon's got a little weirdness to it, but that's going to be another delectable for no

reason. I know it has the Layer-2 use case you talk about, but People are just going to

gravitate to that, maybe in a large fund or something. It will have a really big buying

thrust, I'd say more in the winter time frame.

55 ALGO^ $0.22 <$5 < 21.5 X

Tia’s message from spirit on 8 October 2025 follows: Algo. Yes, a little bit under

it’s day in the sun, just slower than many when we first looked at it a couple of years

ago. It’s a good one for those who were patient.

Tia’s message from spirit on 8 October 2025 follows: Hyperliquid. Need to bump

that up. Easy. That's a money machine. However, that does not have a long term on

that. Just remember it’s more of a “this cycle” type of coin. I feel you could raise that to

the 200 range. This is very weird. They're (spirit) showing me like this is good in a

period of time, but then when they show me further out it isn’t good. They're showing

me on that, that this is going to be here and then it's going to stop. Take it up to maybe

$200 and then be done. Don’t press this too far. If you want to be greedy to 400 or

Tia’s message from spirit on 8 October 2025 follows: Aster. Keep the targets the

people who put this out didn't do all of the necessary work on this coin yet, so that is

part of the “fun” moving forward, they put this coin out and kind of said, "Hey, let's “f”

around and find out." It is doing better than they anticipated and they didn't put all the

fuel in the car yet. They’re scrambling and sometimes that’s when mistakes happen.

you that's going one or two ways. You can mark it. It can go either way. This is not a

SUI or TAO or GRASS or GUNZ or DOGE or like some of the coins where I just get a

lot of juice and they are more energized. Plasma is either going to be a blow it out or

it's going to fail. This is going to be one of those coins that it's not, oh, we're going to sit

you're going to know that after the five dollar marker.

about yet. That's going to be a slow run for a bit, but I definitely feel that there is

longevity on it. Since I’m not getting a number, let’s just start with $4.40 and take it

from there. Yeah, that's what I would do. You're going to get longevity out of that

point. They’re (spirit) telling me the word is, they're telling me it's rock-solid. This

is something we need to make sure we cover somewhat regularly. Chip picked this

one. Nice one, Chip. Yeah, gotta show Chip a little favoritism on coin requests once

perpetual. It's sleepy and then when it runs it's going to have big runs. I even feel it gets

closer to the $180 on it’s final push. Target can be $170 to $180. If you're looking for

that to give you this warm and fuzzy in the beginning, you’re not getting that. You need

just so explicit.

Interviewer: I prayed for this. Not that it has anything to do with me, but I

asked for super clarity, from good for good. That would really help the

group and just make this thing something that stands the test of time and

people could come back to it in the future and go, "Wow, this was amazing.

There's no other explanation than she was getting information from spirit."

Tia’s message from spirit on 8 October 2025 follows: GUNZ. When it gets going,

it's going to run hot. These targets may seem high to some, but leave the targets. Yeah,

it's going to run hot. We're going to have to change that second number somewhere in

the future to something higher. I don't know if you want to put an asterisk or

something, but there's, for all the ones that we know that have massive potential

to move forward, I really think that's going to kind of surprise us. I’m buying

some. I’m also adding some GRASS to my portfolio after seeing everything today.

there’s nothing there now.

Interviewer: Fair enough. You’re probably right. It was one that was

pumped and ran up for a time and now it has completely dumped. It

should still get a nice speculative run when AI starts moving, but we’ll

share your exact message. That’s what we care about. I wouldn’t buy it,

but at this price I don’t know that I would sell it either. That’s my two cents.

Wrapping up crypto!

I want to finish up our crypto portion of the annual report with what I believe is one of the

most important messages.

They (spirit) shared something earlier, and they (spirit) want me to emphasize it. There

will be two distinct groups of people. Those who got into crypto early and those who

didn’t.

There will be the haves and the have-nots. This IS the “next” revolution. Some will say

AI, okay, but this plays into that.

For your own good, some of you have to try and calm yourselves when it comes to the

daily and weekly market moves. You have to shift now into “Pro” (professional) mode.

They (spirit) are showing me this is like, over the course of human history, this is one of

those very rare opportunities to “move up” the ladder financially.

Back in the day, royalty had all the money, and you needed to be born into it. Then we

had the energy and industrial revolutions and new titans grew from nothing. Then we

had the technology and information revolutions and fortunes were made seemingly

overnight.

We are now in the early innings of crypto and you guys have a big leg up. All you have

to do is remain calm and play the 7-year game. I hope that hits home. This isn’t like

anything I have ever seen. This is big, big, big! Like crazy big. A life changing

opportunity and you have a front row seat and you’re in the game.

Global & Spiritual (Non-Crypto)

Non crypto theme for 2026?

Dare I say it. Let’s pray and we can neutralize this. A major problem that we have in

2026, that they have to squash, which is problematic around the world, is terrorism. We

are completely threatened and that ‘s going to be a problem because it affects many

things, including our financial status and our apparatus.

They have to get a hold of, you're going to see so many problems in Europe with

terrorism. That’s going to be a problem and it will only be exacerbated because they're

already holding everything down financially right now. They (Europe) are presenting a

false front in the way they are backing Ukraine with money they don’t have. It’s

breaking them and they don’t want Putin to know this, but he does.

There are cracks in Europe. Such a combination of factors and it could have been

addressed and avoided. It’s too late now. Until they decide to get a grip on things, all

this majesty bullshit, they have to get a grip on the financial and terrorist factor right now,

they have to get a grip on it because if you don't think that that is going to drive a wedge

financially with the stock market, currency and crypto, it will, and that's what's going to

be the catalyst to getting a grip on it. Because something really catastrophic is going to

happen and that’s what it takes for people to wake up. Reread what I just said.

Catastrophic impact financially for Europe in the next year or so and they will be forced

to take action and make big changes to their system. Will they get things functional?

Yes, but not without people losing more confidence in their system. It feels like they are

just waiting for it to break so they can do what they want. Yeah, you’re going to see the

crazy CBDC stuff and more controls in Europe. So sad! As I have been warning for

years, people need to unite and peacefully fight this.

The Next US President.

They (spirit) just said the successor after Trump is already in place. Do I think it's Vance?

Most probable, yes. The successor is already in place and Trump will still be pulling all

of the strings.

They're (spirit) saying that Trump will not leave this office completely until his death. So

I’m not saying Trump will have an official third term, but he will be pulling the strings.

Trump, even from the grave will have lasting impact and I’m not saying he won’t make it

through his term. I’m saying he will be present during the next presidency, the primary

influence.

Did you hear that Musk, as we published months ago, he let go of that whole third party

nonsense. He said, "I think I'm going to let go of that nonsense and I think I'm going to

back Vance." That's what Musk recently said.

Listen, Musk went so on the DL (down low) . You don't really hear of him much, do you?

Not like you did months ago. You don't see him much. And if people really can’t see why,

they’re head is in the sand. That whole blow up between he and Trump was

orchestrated like a wresting match and it worked. It needed to be just believable

enough so the wackadoodles would leave Elon and his businesses alone. This thing

was set up by Trump for the average Joe to believe there was really an argument

because now nobody's setting Teslas on fire and they‘re opening new Tesla places and

Tesla will recover and already is. Tesla will expand its projects and services too. And I

think what people are going to be surprised about is Elon will bring big time functionality

in with Tesla and be adding in fuel. I don't think he's going to stay all electric.

Elon will not stay all electric. Bottom line, when Tesla, when they were keying them,

blowing them up and they blew one up in front of the hotel in Vegas, Trump said, "Listen,

you were a catalyst to getting me elected and they're going to ruin everything that

you've worked for and done." So a staged break up and if you've noticed, Elon went

very quiet relative to what he had been and now he is being left alone to rise up again.

Like we shared months ago when it first happened, that was planned.

AI and mass unemployment?

There can be good to it, there can be bad to it, like most things.

Here's the thing with AI, you know it is progressing quickly. I mean you do a search on

your phone or anything. You're getting the best answers you ever got and you're getting

them quick so you can already see the evolution of it. There are lots of different

projections on this. What percent of jobs do you think will be replaced by AI? Is it less

than 50% in 5 to 10 years? Is it more?

So if you haven’t by now, you will start seeing more and more predictions about what

percent of jobs will be replaced in the next 5 to 10 years by AI. Those predictions are

mostly coming from forward thinking people. How do I say this, the early adopters are

often right on the concept but wrong about the “how long it takes” aspect. I can see

conceptually they are right, they are just way early in their fantasy of how it plays out.

This (AI) will take much much longer then they think. 10 to 20 years before all of the

kinks are worked out and it has replaced the bulk of human jobs. This isn’t anything

people need to have on their bingo card as far as mass unemployment in the next 5

years. You can chill. Am I saying this isn’t important? No. It is, but it’s more in the

future where we’re looking at challenging aspects of job displacement and who knows

what solutions may come into play by then. That being said, best to get your financial

house in order now, early in this game and as I have already stated, best to get your

financial house in order in the next 5 years as that is when you have some of the best

opportunities.

I really feel that everything set on this course, which is AI, is extremely premature. I feel

that it's being said to the public of being this superstar and ready for prime time. Listen,

AI is the next thing and it is a big deal, but we’re in the very early innings on this. Think

about it like crypto in 2010. And the bugs and the kinks are plentiful, needless to say. It

can't be in the place of humans to every degree. All of this information, just run by AI,

no, not for some time. The sensitivity of being broken into by your enemy is far too high.

And you're going to see major casualties by people that take this to the extent

prematurely. We already had a man... I mean this guy was using AI to diagnose his

sick mother and it gave advice to him to go ahead and kill himself and his mother?

I feel in 15 to 20 years it takes over probably 20 to 50% of jobs because accountants,

most doctors, lawyers, you talk about any of the finance advisors, you just talk about

nine out of 10 engineers, nine out of 10 jobs, they generally only get messed up

because of people. And a computer can already do them better than people. That

being said, listen, it's going to be sold as it's going to fix everything in five to 10 years or

take over in five, 10 years, but you're looking more 10 to 20, especially for the “higher

responsibility” type of things.

I'm getting the word radical. It has a very radical problem to it. I know that. So we have

done work in the supernatural spiritual realm, we have found that we know through the

internet that evil has a really strong placement in it. There are certain things in the dark

web that you could watch and there is literally, you could be possessed by watching that

video.

So we know this about the internet, we know this, the people like me who do what I do,

we know about this and have known about this. Now we’re talking AI, this is hand in

hand. This isn't just something of saying, "We're going to look at this and this is going to

be our next revolutionary way of having things done." There's always the good, the bad

and the ugly. And that's the part for us (light workers) that we worry about. Many who

are like me, we worry about how this will transfer as far as evil being able to take over

your children? That kind of a thing. The web in general and technology in general has

allowed the devil so much power on the planet.

Bottom line, computers are just computers. They are not human beings. They are

computers. There is a massive spiritual component to life, not computers. We are not

humans having a spiritual experience on earth. It is the other way around. We are

spiritual beings having a human experience and it is best not to forget that. Sometimes

I tire of people who don't decipher that.

Listen, if you just go by the book and the code and the rule, you don't need parents or

leaders. A parent or a mentor or a true leader is someone who can factor in all the

human elements and then make adjustments based upon the whole picture. It's not just

ones and zeros or black and white always. Human beings, there's more to it. What

about love and connection.

Career wise, go to where you are drawn. Sure, go towards spiritual careers, go towards

personal experience careers, go towards those things that can't be replaced by

computers. However, there’s a lot of time before we’re looking at “mass mass layoffs”

from AI. You’re getting the dooms day messages right now and maybe that’s okay

because as long as you don’t let it bring you to your knees in fear, you can start to

calmly think about it while there’s plenty of time.

I think it's very true that there are certain jobs that will be eliminated. Listen, there have

already been jobs that have been resourced over to computers since you and I grew up.

Listen, it's not going to happen as quick as they say, but it will happen over time. I feel

people are rushing the whole thing.

Charlie Kirk assassination?

Charlie Kirk's death was 100% put in motion and done by someone else. That guy who I

saw they would catch, even before they caught him, he didn’t do it. Nothing about that

gun made any sense.

Tyler Robinson was initiated by someone in college. When I look at things, remember

when it first happened, you asked me “will they ever “catch or get” anyone for this?”

When you initially asked, I got surface info and was able to share they would catch

someone and gave a description of who that person was, but most people know we

need to look deeper on this.

What I believe is that he was recruited in college. Once he got recruited, this was a

very young man and they said... I feel there was a form of MK Ultra done. I think along

with the MK Ultra was the threat that they were going to kill his whole family. And I feel

MK Ultra together along with the threat, you just go up on the roof and then we just

need you to do X, Y and Z. Just me on this next point, not spirit, but I think it was

Mossad. I shouldn’t give my personal opinion, but I think Mossad was involved.

I feel there was a drone, and I don't even think there was a shooter in the traditional

sense.

Question from interviewer: It's funny because here's the thing, when we

initially asked you about this, you said, "All I can tell you is I see them

catching a young man, one person is who they catch.” You just said, "I

see them catching just one young man and he's like, he's got mental

illness, he's messed up in the head.” You said that before they caught him.

And when they caught the young man and it matched your description, I

didn't ask you, because I didn't think to, is there more to this story, and

that's what this question's about.

The dead giveaway is the World War II gun. I don’t have all the answers on this, nobody

does. What I am certain of, what’s very cliear, this was something that was way into a

political arena.

Do I think that Trump knows about this? 100%. Do I think this will ever be made public?

No.

Supreme Court ruling on Trump’s

“Emergency tariffs?”

I see them going through, but they may need to be altered in some way.

Here’s what nobody is factoring in right now. Something is going to happen prior to that.

Something will happen that is almost going to knock it down a little bit. So, he's (Trump)

going to do something of grace that's going to be really good for the country and then

it's almost going to make that where it's predicated, look, this guy's (Trump) doing what

he's going to do. The last thing we need to do is knock that down now.

So, I feel like he's (Trump) again in the chess game and before that goes to final court

ruling, something is going to be done by him. And they're going to be like they can't

disrupt the entire United States or at least not 100%.

Trump and the aliens, not like “illegal

aliens” some talk about!

I can see another species is helping Trump. I did just see a lot of light around it (the

other species). Light which penetrated from the inside, not like when you see something

illuminated which is more angelic.

I saw a figure and then I saw an illumination. This was something where the light was

coming out of the mouth, it was inside of it, engulfed in it. Angelic beings are different

from this. Angelic beings don't look like that or communicate the same way. So I saw

that part of it. That’s another species. That’s, call it what you will, alien. And this

particular species helping Trump is benevolent, helpful to humanity.

You know there are many species of “aliens” and some are helpful/good while others

are not. I have seen giant beings, they're just enormous and dangerous and nasty and

horrible. We also know of the bad in a demonic fashion as well, that they can be these

enormous beings, bigger than you can imagine. So I feel many people misconstrue

between the two worlds. I went off on a tangent there. Bottom line, I see Trump has

guidance that's being given from both the angelic side and the “other species” side as

well.

2025/2026 Copyright TIA BELLE and Team – do not copy, post or reprint Page 78 of 116

You want to know what this species looks like? This will sound bat shit crazy to some of

our friends, but it’s the annual report so let’s just let it fly. It looks like a Gecko, but more

of a human form. When you watch the Geico commercials, that little shit in those

commercials, if you were to take that, but make it more of a, not green, and it's more of

a translucent being that's not a tiny being, bigger. That's what it looks like to me, but

the light comes from within. That was the striking part, when I saw that.

He's not of this world, completely, Trump. He is not of this world in a sense, and I get

angry when people say that he is evil and you know why? Because it's the same

principle of what people say about me. They say that because I have a gift. They say

that because I get the messages that I get that I have to have them come from evil and

it’s just really the dumbest lie perpetuated by the people who know the least. That is

one of the biggest pet peeves of my life.

Do you know how many passages there are in the Bible about the few with strong

psychic gifts, I'm not saying I’m a “prophet,” but prophets get messages. It's over and

over and over again in recorded history and really what the Bible's talking about are

people with abilities or who get messages from Spirit. It's in so many passages in the

Bible. It's crazy. But then, listen, it's (the bible) a man-made book and we all know that.

So we all know that it's a man-made book and there are going to be exceptions to the

rule and that some things are not truthful and I think that’s where zealots start going into

the mediumship and all of that, that's so contradicted to what the perception of a

prophet is. It just doesn't make sense where it makes that turn, but it does.

In a nutshell, to stay on point, I feel like Trump is definitely on the light side. I feel like

he has been fighting tremendous evil. Tremendous, tremendous that has been at play

here for so long.

Summing this seemingly crazy thread up, Trump is working with other species. The

alien world and the world of crossing over to that dimension, they all kind of coincide

together, and when I was doing some work last week, I was able to take myself to a

calm place. I was by myself and all of a sudden I saw this light beam working with him

(Trump) and I'm like, so he is really getting a lot of other information. I saw him (Trump)

working with a light beam. We also have the divine world really working on keeping him

safe. Bottom line, Trump is getting a lot of help from the “heavens” and other “species.”

He has a job to do. There's a job that's a little bit more than just, "Oh, let's orchestrate

as the President." It’s more involved than just that. So Trump is being definitely guided.

People are going to think this sounds crazy.

Can you tell us more about Trump and the Alien?

I feel that “being” is telling Trump in advance what the plans are around the world, and

that's why he's making the moves with Putin and other country leaders. Just bear with

me while I get this out. I’m going to be a little all over the place for a minute, but I want

to get this out.

The “being” is telling him, "Oh, they've got a bomb set to do this," or, "They're going to

go do that," and this is going to be, because if they go to war with each other, of course

2025/2026 Copyright TIA BELLE and Team – do not copy, post or reprint Page 79 of 116

it affects the entire universe. So now all of a sudden, and for people that don't know,

some of the largest human trafficking is in the Ukraine. And for people that don't know

that, that is a fact.

So he has the meeting with Putin and he has the meeting with Zelensky and announces

one week later, all of a sudden the priority of the First Lady is that there are going to be

children found and that human trafficking is going to come to a halt. Guess what? That's

because he met with Zelensky because it's rampant in his country.

Aliens inhabit the Earth before

humans?

“Aliens” didn't inhabit this Earth before humans, but...

But they did come here over the millennia and interact with humans. Of great

importance, they were catalysts for great advancements for humans ... Please share

this with the group. I had an Uber driver last week, and the Uber driver was from Egypt.

He said he grew up there and went on to say the history in Egypt, all Egyptians who

grew up there know that otherworldly help was provided.

Some debate the origin of the pyramids. Okay, if you don’t believe “aliens” were

involved in any capacity, okay, then let’s move on to mummification. I did autopsies

(present for) for many years as a police detective. And so, one of the things that

fascinates me about mummification is that I don't know if you know this, or not, but they

would shrink the brain and pull it through the nostril with something that looked like a

crochet needle.

So, where did the chemicals come from? So, the chemicals ... we also know the

bandages were also treated with chemicals. How did they know to shrink a brain to be

able to pull it out of a nostril? Again, I've been involved in a ton of autopsies and it's

next to impossible, even today.

And so, many things had to be brought here, and even if you question the whole

extraterrestrial, you have to question and look at the materials they had.

You can see where there have been examples of introductions and leaps of technology

that you know were given to the human race by aliens. It's these gifts for us to build on,

and then they lead to big leaps.

2025/2026 Copyright TIA BELLE and Team – do not copy, post or reprint Page 80 of 116

There are things that are unexplained, but they're only unexplained to those who don’t

seek information.

There's so much more than we could even ever imagine, and look at the government.

There are many different variations of aliens or call them what you’d like. And, yes, I

believe they're referenced in the Bible.

Bottom line, it might be challenging for some to wrap their heads around, but this, our

existences are just dimensions that we live in.

I do believe they (alien species) utilize the ocean. The ocean is something that's very

vast. I do believe there's good people, bad people, and I feel there are good

extraterrestrials, and then there's the not so good. And I feel they have their own wars

among themselves.

Not to get too crazy, but this is the annual report so I’m a little more blunt. There's the

impregnation, all of that, of wanting to cross with, the different blood types, all of that, I

think there's been a little bit of “fuck around, find out.”

There are many different species of extraterrestrials. More than 10 but I don't see that

there are hundreds.

Will we have a “watershed” moment

where the global population comes

face to face with an alien species? A

moment when it’s known as fact by

the masses?

I think, really, truly, I just want people to realize that while you may be able to handle

this, most people can't handle this. If you look at the sheer number of people who

couldn’t manage the fear, uncertainty, and challenges that came with “COVID,” do you

really think they're ready to see an alien at a press conference with global leaders or a

spaceship parked in DC, NYC, London, Paris, Moscow or wherever? Let's just keep it

real. No mass contact that is undeniable and accepted as truth by the majority, it would

put too many people on tilt. You know this. It’s a fantasy some keep perpetuating. Not

happening in my lifetime.

2025/2026 Copyright TIA BELLE and Team – do not copy, post or reprint Page 81 of 116

Pretty much what you have seen over the years, there's a trickle out of information, and

sightings, and so it continues for now. Any one with half a brain and an ounce of

curiosity knows “we are not alone.” Bottom line, the “alien” situation remains status quo

and it's not changing next year or the year after or the year after. There's no mass

introduction to the aliens in the ... You're not going to meet them next year.

The fragility of human psychology aside, there’s something else people need to

understand. There are contamination risks, to some degree. That’s what they’re (spirit)

showing me. Interaction can bring increased radiation levels. There can be a

dangerous physical aspect here, of interaction.

The truth about comet A1 Atlas?

I'm not a big fan of the whole comet thing and I'm going to tell you why. Because they

always love to blow it out of proportion, try to make it like a movie where it's going to hit

the earth and we all know it never gets here. So, I really don't waste my time too much

on flying rocks.

Q: Okay. So we all know A1 Atlas refers to the third known interstellar object, formerly

designated C1 Atlas, an interstellar comet discovered in 2025. Its unique, fast-moving

object that came from beyond our solar system, showing signs of being a comet with a

large amount of carbon dioxide. While it's a comet, it's unusual composition and

characteristics have led to speculate theories including the possibility it could be an

artificial spacecraft. So this A1 comet, is it just a comet or a spacecraft or what?

I feel it's a comet. They (spirit) aren’t telling me anything else so that’s my final answer.

More on Trump!

As much as they try to push him down, he rises up.

I see he has a mole, he has a mole that's in his tight knit group. And I feel like there's

going to be some sort of a disagreement with a family member and that family member

is going to be a mole. And I don't know why, but my brain and my left eye kept going to

Ivanka's husband. Jared Kushner. He doesn't get along with Trump's boys. He's

outsourced. I feel there's trouble down the pike with him.

Trump really does love this country. I mean, you have to see the symbols I’m seeing

that surround him, the White House, the heart, all the decisions, how he doesn't want to

let the American people down. Yes, there is a little egocentric aspect to him, but who

wouldn't be, you're the president. I'm sure all of them were egocentric. You don’t even

run for president unless you are egocentric, right.

There's a new grand baby that will come into his life within the next year to two years.

So, the family continues to grow with a lot of abundance around it and health and family

life, which he considers to be extremely important.

Trump has some health issue, but it would be a manageable one. I don't feel like it's

something critical and it's just more manageable, meds, etc., stress, those kinds of

things that would cause something to just be worse.

So, I feel like he's really being watched over as far as his health is concerned, and

they're already running the campaign for the next election in their minds. There's three

years left of his term, they're already running that entire show already of that election.

Right now, as mentioned, it’s going to be Vance. That is most probalbe and I feel Kirk

would've been the running mate until what happened to him.

They want to keep everything tight, in where it is. They're not looking to bring in any

newbies, any newbie Republicans that are not partaking in what's happening now.

Out of loyalty and function and who they know and trust. There's a trust symbol. So

yeah, so we've got a good two years looking forward with Trump. Bumps in the road,

yes, but solutions come.

Trump is going to go under severe pressures because of threats... There are so many

threats upon his life and his family's life, which is very sad in our day and age. He’s

basically running a war to try and end wars. But the difference between the wars that

we've had to deal with that you partook in, for instance, we brought people over there,

left them, made them fight. This president doesn't do that. This man accelerates, takes

2025/2026 Copyright TIA BELLE and Team – do not copy, post or reprint Page 83 of 116

his men and women, brings the heat and bombs until it’s done. And that's what I feel is

going on. And I do see tensions very high between him and Netanyahu.

Again, they're (opposition to Trump) so frustrated and blocked in every aspect of how

they want things to go. I mean, I just said to my girlfriend the other night, I said, "I hope

the Secret Service is doing their due diligence for Trump’s children because there's

nothing more painful in life than to lose a child." And this is something for me that really

hits home hard is that I don't think people are even a quarter aware of how in jeopardy

his children are.

the level of jeopardy right now on his children is so high. And I think people realize a

portion of that, but they (the opposition) want, I mean, look at the way they killed Charlie

Kirk. I don't know why they did not do a better job protecting him. I don't know why he

wasn't better protected. Do you know he was a potential VP candidate for the next

election? He was being considered and “they” new it and that is why he was

assassinated.

Bottom line, setbacks, sure, but overall, for Trump and the US, it’s going to be amazing.

It's not going to be good, it's going to be amazing. He (Trump) wants to make history.

And for all of the positive reasons, not like the other ding dongs that put up statutes for

fentanyl dealers. This is going to be someone that is going to create history for all the

right reasons, for net positive.

We will have some challenges next year with the debt, but he will be able to fix those

challenges. So, economically, probably somewhat of a mixed bag next year, but

whatever challenges, we'll get back on our feet and start chugging forward again.

I feel next year for us the process begins for Trump showing people what it's like to

have lived in America in the past where we dominated, and we actually made money,

and didn't live like we were on food lines.

And the other thing that I love is he's going to start fixing, and cleaning up the

homelessness. It takes time, but it is on the list of things to get moving in the right

direction.
