my laptop and my wi-fi and it was holding out all day but sometimes with the vps it would drop out so i've just got to work with the vps provider and just make sure that their service is compatible with apex products like let's try to be yeah what i notice is it's not that the vps is the problem as much as the apex connection is sometimes a little bit iffy that's what i've noticed yeah okay okay yeah so what that means though is that um like so there are um there's services and tools that will um like notify you if there's like a um uh like a disconnection and the internet connection like goes down and those services will will like notify you um you know like when it comes back online um and you'll get a you know a message you know saying that it was offline at x time and you know and it'll tell you like when it was offline um the last you know like it'll it'll like take a note of when it was last online and when it comes back online it'll give you like a time frame and um and so those are good for that kind of service but like ultimately if apex has or trade evader rhythmic has like a hiccup that's a different kind of problem that it like the vps can't solve that kind of a problem if that makes sense so it's kind of like you know like the weakest link kind of a a problem whereas vps can solve the internet connectivity problem just like starlink right if starlink works but the connection with apex is a problem then you solve one problem but you had a different kind of problem so um yeah we've had a few people have like we have one person who has no matter what she just always has tons of apex problems i've experienced a little bit of a but there's some people who just have no matter what they even switch servers or sometimes they try chicago sometimes i try to new york sometimes i even switch vps providers and i'm like i've never had that many problems some people just have tons of problems i've i've had a few problems minor but not um not the level that some people have um but you know i guess just try try something try see see what works for you um but but you have a question the benefit of vps is the the always on connectivity but again if apex has a hiccup uh with their connection that's you can't think vps won't solve that what would you say matt sorry i'm breaking up a little bit but what would you say is the most common and or most popular more consistent maybe is what i'm getting at a combination rhythmic and which vps like or trade of eight and which vps like do you do you find that there is some that work better than others or are you talking about vps or um so like i personally like trade of a better than rhythmic personally um because uh like the bot sometimes will will issue cancel order so it'll try to throw out an order and then sometimes it'll cancel the order rhythmic has notoriously sometimes rejected a cancel order so imagine throwing out an order in the boss like okay never mind cancel that order and the rhythmic will say nope we're going to reject your cancel order now we're going to fill your order and then it's like wait a sec i try to cancel that order you know and then you have other and then it's like we're now in a trade that we didn't want to be in and you know and so that's you know so i personally like trade of a better myself i personally use forex vps there's a few uh you know other providers that people use but um that's that's you know it's personal preference i've tried rhythmic and i had a whole bunch of problems with rhythmic i switched to trade of eight and like ninety percent of those problems just went away when i switched to trade of eight so yeah tom what do you do you have problems with uh rhythmic trade of eight what are your i use trade of eight uh i don't have any problems with it actually i do it keeps disconnecting randomly throughout the week and i have to keep uh reconnecting it it's not it's not too bad but sometimes the uh the strategies get unclicked so i have to reclick them all but that's it's not too bad right it's bad in a sense let's say i you know i don't pay attention for a week and it goes out on monday and then i lost entirely okay got it but did you say these are not alerts or no um we're working on well so we actually have a new version that we're testing out um we wanted to build that it's just our developer said it's going to take quite a few it's going to be a big project so we were like oh my gosh i don't know if we can commit to that kind of project just yet um so uh we're trying to weigh you know way because we have to set up like a centralized server and then we have to like subscribe to twilio and mailgun and we have to it's going to be a bigger project than we originally thought but we we do have a new version of the account dashboard that will kind of solve some of the problems a slightly different way so um we'll talk about that here in just a second is it is it on ninja trader can't they just send an email um well so like you have to have like an email provider right so like um you have to have some way to send an email like some kind of outgoing email service okay yeah yeah yeah and so that would require like uh like something like mailgun like an outgoing um like a like a transactional email service right yeah and and then we'd have to subscribe and have an account and then we'd have to have a centralized location where um ninja trader notifies the centralized location where if we ever change our our account or something you know it has like a handshake to that anyway it long story short it's a little more complex than what we originally thought and our development team quoted us i forget how many hours but it was significantly more than what we were thinking we think i think you think we were thinking it was like 20 or 30 hours and it was significantly more than that like multiples of what we were thinking we're like oh my gosh it's a lot more than what we were thinking it was going to be so we were like okay let's hold off on that for now but what they did do in the interim is they they built i think it's the i go back and double check i think it's the dashboard 3.5 or 3.6 something like that um i have to double check what what the latest version is um but what they did was they like if you have a we got like a light yeah 3.6 but but basically uh like if you have a a position that doesn't have a stop loss or take profit um it can create the stop loss or take profit that's that's like the ultimate problem that happens um if you if you're disconnected um so that's that's one of the problems that occurs right because the the first step in uh getting a position opened is you know you have like an oco order right and once it's filled after it's filled then it creates a stop loss and take profit right but if there's a disconnect after the position gets filled then you have a position with no stop loss or take profit right and that could be disastrous if that continues and moves against you in a in a you know for two hours like it could blow up an account and so that's kind of where the the we have some other stop measures that automatically checks for that so we do have that in the interim you know some other things in place to kind of check for that um but that's that's kind of like a uh i think it's uh yeah so it's version 3.6 um that that was being tested yesterday as last i heard it was being tested yesterday so we have some new versions of that to try to fix some of the ultimate like problems that arise out of the disconnection my uh issues my personal feeling is that um apex when they offer these 80 90 off they have uh zillions of customers and they have way too many customers for the you know for the infrastructure they they offer and when you have too many customers connecting at any one moment you're gonna have some disconnects right uh it's kind of like rush hour where it's not always doesn't always happen but when it happens some people get disconnected right um and that's why it's an intermittent thing um that's my personal feeling that's why when you switch to different vps providers you still have the problem that's why uh when you create even when you go from uh apex to um what's another um funded account i'm drawing blanks on another funded account program what's the name of another funded account program guys off trader top step yeah or funded trader they people people switch funded account providers that use trade evade and rhythmic same thing they still have this they they all complain about the same exact problem and that's because same thing they have too too many customers for the infrastructure that's my personal feeling again that's the common thing right so that's not something we can solve we can kind of have some stop gaps and some things but that's the ultimate issue i i feel like um when we had the meditator funding account problems we didn't have any of these issues but you know we had other issues but not this one so it is what it is it's just something that's slightly irritating at the moment and i'm sure they'll solve it at some point but um you know it is and you know i apologize i know it's it's kind of a pain so yeah so but yeah um tom thanks for sharing the your uh your uh notes there on the hardware yeah obviously um there are some things we can do to minimize the the like if you have um you know if you have uh internet issues or you have low um like low hardware like minimal hardware problems that could choke the resources which could cause internet um disconnect issues so matt i um for this class is can we go over um i guess the performance of our bots and get some feedback or you have something else oh yeah yeah we can yeah absolutely so um so right before you joined we were talking to we were just talking about the uh the kind of the vps and the the volume but yeah let's let's talk about um i do want to go over something else but let's talk about uh we'll have some time to touch on the the 10 ema but let's go ahead let's go ahead and uh you want to share your screen yeah thanks man i really appreciate this yeah yeah no worries i feel like i'm struggling a bit but i definitely use some feedback um yeah let's do it can you see that sorry there we go yeah um yeah i i hope like some of these bots uh they go negative like here's this one the mega orb and then um all right let me ask you a question how many let's take a step back how many bots are you running in a week or i think i have one looks like you got about what 10 there uh four times i have three accounts so like 12 bucks it looks like 12 right there it's 12 yeah so how many like how many trades per week is that um i don't i don't know i gotta i don't know some of those probably take multiple trades per day i assume yeah they do yeah but i it's kind of i balanced it because some just trade monday and then let's say tuesday so then that's one bot here and then this one trades like thursday it's kind of like like that right okay so it's some of them is monday to friday and they do overlap on days but i just try to balance it as much as i can okay got it so the first thing i would say is uh can we start by looking at like a back test of whichever one you want to start with um yeah let's start with the nr7 mnq 8 minute maybe i might not have all of it on this computer because the the biggest thing i've noticed is um like the the easiest thing and i'm not even sure what mhg i see mhg and i'm not even sure what ticker that is um but the like the thing that i've started working towards is trying to find something that works reasonably well across monday through friday right so instead of having five like a monday bot of tuesday wednesday thursday friday i got something that work all all five days so instead of having a five bots i just have one that works all five days and that's so much easier to manage so much easier to like pay attention to to you know it's just a lot easier to so that so that so then i can just run a monday to friday um but you have to relax the criteria just a little bit like not to you know it still has to meet some certain criteria but um but that's so much easier to to look at and manage and it'll take two or three trades in a day but it's a lot easier instead of having like you know your list of 12 here it's i just have maybe one or two or three instead of but it's so much easier to like manage right but let's go ahead and look at what you have for the what is it the nr7 mnq eight minute that very top option there all right and by the way how many accounts do you have three three accounts okay got it so do you want to do uh the new strategy you know yeah and you have templates for all of these setup i have it all on the um the forex vps i might not have it on my laptop but i'll check i'll check what's there okay got it you have like some what did i say like r2d2 is that yeah i have some naming convention so like let's say i go to um this nr7 if i edit the strategy um i have uh like an identifier so i'm template load and i know a 902542 yeah and i can load that on my strategy and i'll enter here so then because it's it's a different because it's on a laptop and i think so i can't sync it so i just use identifiers okay so here here's the question um if if you're saving the strategy and if you're saving the template as a an optimizer how do you and you're loading it as an optimizer how do you use it back to it's a back toast because it's showing it as optimizer though when you click load it's an actual optimizer yeah you're right this this yeah no i i i hand i manually by hand move the settings over to forex vps to the vps version right like what i'm saying is like because i actually i saw someone do this the other day i'm like i didn't even know you did but like like when you click um click template real quick again just the template option there the bottom right yeah click load click that middle option the i don't know whatever that is yeah mnq5k yeah click load like it'll load right like the it's basically the optimization right okay now hit cancel right there in the top right top right the x just close that window out minimize that one minimize it minimize this one yeah but like you can actually click template right here right yeah and hit load and you can literally load this like go um sorry hit cancel um click uh click cancel here yeah wait this is the vps i think wait is it no no sorry cancel um yeah yeah right click and go to new strategy what which um strategy were we just looking at where you had seven okay got it so right click then click edit strategy okay yeah and then like click template again whatever like where was that middle option load no because you were looking at when you saw the middle option it was on my laptop this is the forex vps that's why it's a little confusing oh this is remote no what i'm saying is i actually saw someone do this the other day right where what they did was they they had an optimization template saved and they picked it here for an actual bot and i'm like i have no idea what would actually happen if you did that do you follow what i'm saying yeah because it's supposed to be like and he's like well i'm having problems i'm like i didn't know you could do that and and and when he ran the optimization um in the back test the analyzer it said one it was like 20 000 it was running test one of 20 000 i'm like how does it know which one to pick because there's like 20 000 back tests and you're loading 20 000 as a template i don't know which one of the 20 000 to use probably the first one like yeah it's giving me weird results when i run this and i'm like you should be loading a single back test not one of 20 000 you see what i'm saying yeah it was so i i guess i understand what you're saying that you're looking at the remote desktop connection in this case but yeah yeah so i mean so i guess however you want to get to it to run the back test let's um let's look at the back test wait um so rather tend to load i mean it it has to outline something right because it's running a an optimizer you know what let me try another example it's maybe bad okay because like you should have like a single back test like with with a single one single standalone result yeah unfortunately that's on my desktop right so this is my laptop so let me try the volume while you're doing that do you want me to like just go over the 10 ema while you're trying to get that yeah i'll set that up and then if you go over that which is we're like 30 minutes into stuff okay okay yeah yeah okay got it okay so let me share okay so what we're going to review is we're going to talk about the 10 ema strategy and uh let's see the 10 ema 10 ema where is it at okay here we go so the 10 ema was a um it's you guys should be able to see my screen now correct yep let's see if i have some templates in here yep okay i'm just going to run a quick uh june 2025 and what we're going to do is we're going to look at a chart real quick let this run and there's um there's a couple so the 10 ema is it a um it's a trending strategy so the way that this works is this this is a strategy that came from a former company that i used to own and when i left it and sold my ownership tracy ball myself robert thompson all of us used to all be affiliated with the company and when we left we all kind of came over and that's kind of how push button trading started but the way that the strategy works and as soon as this back test is done the way that works is if you have a bearish candle so you have a bearish candle would be like a red or a black candle closing above the 10 ema so the 10 ema is like a uh it's an indicator and the 10 ema represents the 10 exponential moving average right so there's simple moving averages there's exponential moving averages there's all kinds of variations of the moving average ma means moving average exponential means you give more weight to the most recent time frame like it's like it's more weighted right and so the way that this works is we're looking for the 10 ema so it's like a moving average on your chart and we're looking for a bullish trade what we're looking for is again this is kind of funky but it is a bearish candle for a bullish trade you're looking for the opposite so it's a bearish candle closing above and there are lots of bullish candles that close above but we're looking for it to interact with the 10 ema so it's got to close above and what it's going to do is it's going to kind of act like and trade like the opening range breakout like the orb right so it's going to trigger the signal can't oh there we go finally got some candles and let's take a look okay so you guys see a dot right well it's kind of jump i'm trying to get a cleaner version let's see try to get a couple clean ones okay here is a bearish candle you see the blue dot bearish candle that is closing above this little gold line is my 10x 10 ema line okay there's a bearish candle closing above so it's going to set up an order wait for a break above remember break above however it doesn't actually break above within five candles so what happens is it closes out my order right so then guess what it waits for the next time now this candle right here this red candle does that close is it a bearish candle meaning a red or if you if you like black and white candles it would be black in this case it's red it does that close above the 10ma yes or no yeah yes yes but does it interact or touch the 10ma no no it does not but does this next one where as a blue dot touch and interact with the 10ma it does yeah it does so this is a trigger aka a signal candle it interacts with it it is a uh so we got a break above so we're we're gonna set up a trade high above so a break above so we're gonna add an entry candle here stop below and we're waiting for a break above right so that you guys can see just like an orb it plays just like the orb entry above stop below profit taker above boom quick you know two three candles we're in boom why is the interaction important the reason interaction is important is because you may have seen um uh like on some of these candles like this candle right here if you were too far away from uh like like if you were to set up a trade like this you're too far away your take profit would be up here you would never actually hit it you'd actually get stopped out right the reason is because if you're too far away from the moving average you're always going to come back because the moving average is like a rubber band and and right here it doesn't actually interact with is very very close but doesn't actually interact with this this would have worked but it's very very close it just ends up missing it so my personal rule when i'm manually trading my personal rule of thumb is could i take this candle and let's say that that represents half an inch could i draw half an inch below and if i can and there's still extra space it's too far away if this represents half an inch could i draw half an inch and still touch and if i can't then that's that's plenty plenty close close enough right does that make sense yeah it's like this is like just i can put like a sheet of paper barely that's close enough basically right whereas this is too much white space which means it's probably gonna you know come back and the reason that that these are um it's too far away from the moving average and it acts like a rubber band it's gonna it's gonna come back basically and there is a a term it's called like mean reversion you guys know how rubber bands act if it goes too far away what's gonna happen it's gonna come back then it gets too far away and it's gonna come back and it's that's kind of the idea of what happens so we don't really want it to be too far away let me see if i can find a couple more examples of it um yeah so like see right here this example like we were to set up a trade and it actually breaks above it would immediately lose right you see that but um and this candle right here actually this would have worked but it's at 2 30 in the morning so it was outside our starting time right same thing here this one too far away it would have broke above but it's too far away didn't interact with our our um it didn't interact with our moving average right these are not interacting not interacting with our exponential moving average again these are you know early early morning so it's it's outside our um our starting time so that's basically how a bullish trade works again this would have set up but it never actually broke above and in this case uh we had it uh it says right here cancel after five candles meaning one two three four five so five candles it didn't actually break above we're going to close out the trade close out the open order and we're going to pretty much you know set up a wait for the next signal to occur okay now the next thing that would happen would be the opposite of that would be a bearish move and i'm trying to see if i can close trying to cover this up a little bit the next type of move would be a bullish candle again it's the opposite a bullish candle closing below my line again interacting with right interacting with the 10 ema right see that interaction with it just barely kisses that interact uh that high so the high is kissing that level again breaking below we got our order boom right now the reason this is important it's not like the opening range breakout where we're we're we're trying to figure out okay which way are we going to break right in this case we always have a direction figured out right it's always if it's a bullish candle we're always going lower if it's a bearish candle we're always going higher a bullish candle we're going to be shorting if it's a bearish candle we're always going to be bullish all right sorry it's like the opposite a bearish candle going higher bearish candle going long bullish candle going short bullish candle going lower does that make sense and then all of all of the rest of these things are variables you would expect again our entry here stop loss here take profit here right and the other thing that this does have is this has the kind of the old the older way of doing our trailing stop loss which is based on ticks now what this says is start trailing after 20 ticks on m and q'd you guys know what a tick is a tick is 25 cents so how much is 20 ticks five dollars is that correct yeah so what this says is start once you're up five dollars start trailing by five dollars right and you guys can see the scale out here on the right right you guys see that the scale on the right here is basically this represents this is like a twenty dollar twenty dollar scale twenty dollars twenty dollars right so uh you can you can turn that on turn it off that's kind of the older way that we that we did that um did uh that we applied the trailing stop okay now the the 10 ema is a variable so you can optimize it you can try it you can try a 9 you can try a 20 21 like that's a variable you can adjust the these two check boxes won't actually change the actual test itself uh the show 10 ema just draws the line like draws the actual line on the chart so you can see it so if you're trying to troubleshoot it you can you know visually see it the volume actually just draws this little thing down here for you so it's pretty uh it's pretty simple to to see pretty simple to look at if you want again when you're optimizing something uh people are like matt how do i speed up the optimization it's taking too long well the number one advice i always give for optimizations is make sure you you know um like what the workload is right so for example uh don't worry about saturday and sunday if you're testing assets they don't trade on saturday sunday otherwise you're adding a whole bunch of workload that's not going to mean a pile of beans difference you're adding lots of workload it's not going to change the outcome right the other thing i always recommend is when you're when you're um optimizing is i always hard code my risk and max slot size to the account size i don't ever vary those i always hard code those i don't optimize them i hard code them to whatever account size i'm using right so it's going to be 10 of my rate of my drawdown so this is what i would use for 50k um i've seen people like optimize those and they're i've seen some really odd and weird i've seen people say my max slot is like 66 contracts i'm like where the heck did that number come from they're like well that's what the optimization told me it's i've seen some weird stuff i always hard code those don't even worry about the hard code it to what it's supposed to be and just leave it it saves a whole bunch of time on your optimization right um so that's a couple things just to think about and consider um but again the biggest things that really would make the biggest impact when it comes to optimization the things that like the biggest um i don't bang for the buck i would say would be your start time your profit taker and your your chart like whether you're using one minute five minute three minute those are the things that you know and of course your entry can offset along with your start time those in combination those are the things that make the biggest change the biggest bang for the buck the biggest um you know the biggest difference so yeah questions on that how do you optimize the start time you can optimize the start time but you have to do it via the entry candle offset you know what that means no how do you do that so um so you can't directly change this so you can mainly change the start time okay but the start time is like a a text field so you can't really like wrote so like when you when you when you pull down optimization the optimization field this doesn't change like it's not like a let's very very the the start time it's pretty much hard coded right but what you can do is what we we built in is this entry candle offset okay so what this does is it'll look down here your your value and if this is set to one it'll say okay we're gonna add one times three we're gonna add three minutes here okay if this is set to two two times three it's gonna add six minutes if it's set to three three times three is nine minutes so it's gonna add nine minutes but what you can do is change the intricate offset you can optimize the intricate offset and you can run you know zero to 100 on the three minute chart in this case and so it's gonna kind of essentially add and and basically add to the start time dynamically does that make sense it does but it is a little I mean we're a little funky because you can't they won't let you directly change the start time that's the problem that's how we got around but you can't iterate through the entry candle offset right oh you could okay yeah and you can also iterate through the the you can go down here to optimize the data series you can do that and then you can go up here like my favorite thing to do is say three to 15 oops three two all right butterfingers here we go 15 yeah there you go so you can say three to 15 and you can do zero to 50 zero to 100 and so whatever this is it's gonna take the fee so it's basically gonna add to your start times in this case it's set to 918 so if this is it's basically whatever this number is times your times this added to the time so zero times three added to nine however many minutes added to 918 zero times three is zero added to 19 one times three added two times three three times three four times three and then if this goes up to if you have the set to five it'll be zero times five one times five two times five and it'll iterate through all that very very quickly and i'm just cutting in and out a little bit but is that 918 like the eastern time zone when the stock market kind of opens at 9 30 and for me and mountain standard that'd be 7 18 uh so 918 uh yeah so great question so it's basically when you go up here into your options is however you have it configured um when you go into general uh it's whatever you have yours configured to you go up to to options general this is how i have mine configured is central central time zone so it's it's kind of like my local time zone 9 18 for me would be about 48 minutes into the market open gotcha thank you yeah and obviously if you're running vps you know make sure you you understand what time zone you're in and what we have it's set up to yeah what would be actually you know what um i'm gonna cancel that finding a little bit after market open is the best time for futures activity like consistent future activity get away from the yeah it all depends on where there's a lot of movements right yeah it all depends um some it depends on what the strategy is what you're trying to do there's there's a lot of variations of things yeah yeah yeah what's a good start time to iterate from 9 a.m or 8 30 right 8 30 is what i would do yeah oops let me go back to my um my template here yeah yep flip that lid but yeah that's that's the basics of the the strategy does that make sense team yeah it does you bet thanks matt yep and the the the 10 ema is a uh it's a directional strategy the opening range breakout is kind of like neutral like it'll it's it's kind of like a blind ox like it doesn't matter it'll go wherever whereas this because of the candle it'll it'll pick a direction and go a specific direction whereas the open range breakout it doesn't matter it's like direction neutral right so because of this it doesn't have it doesn't use the um uh the the oco orders it just it's like okay this is a bullish candle so we're definitely going to be going bearish right or it's the it's the opposite it uses the opposite candle to pick the direction so the cool part is um just like the other um the other bots is they can do multiple trades per day you guys have probably noticed like over time the all the bots that we're putting out now are can take multiple trades per day the exception was the original orb and the original snapback were like one and done but these can can take multiple you know multiple trades per day yeah so uh yeah pretty cool uh pretty cool stuff yeah i like that yep the um the only other thing i was going to say is when you guys are running a back test or an optimizer always always always run it one more time on high tick high one tick i know you guys may have may not have uh good uh piece of advice matt because i get two quite different results based on that yeah because high one tick is going to be very slow but it's the most accurate okay and before i go in here to template and save i'm going to run it one last time on high tech now i'm not going to run a 20 000 um you know optimizer test on one tick because it's going to literally take forever like i might you know have two birthdays by the time it finishes right and so i'm going to run that on standard i'm just it's kind of like a funnel like i just you know whittle through a couple things and find a few things i might like and then rerun a single back test on high one tick okay and before i save my templates before i like say okay i like this i'm going to run it one more time on high one tick and if i still like it it still meets my criteria i'm going to go down here to save and i'm going to save it as a template right so in this case you guys can see that um when i go into analysis and i go to like day of the week you guys see okay monday tuesday wednesday thursday now i'm gonna run it one more time on friday i don't remember why i didn't pick friday i don't know i don't know if it was a loser or a huge loser or a tiny winner tiny loser i don't remember but that one tick always always always save it as one tick okay now when you go to run the bot live you're going to switch that to standard when you go to run it live when you're running the strategy analyzer high one tick on a single back test it it's very very important okay because that is the most accurate now when people tell me hey matt i ran a back test and the back test didn't match what actually happened live i always say did you run it on historical back did you run the fill processing on one tick if you said no i ran on standard and it had different results i'm like run on one tick oh it matched perfectly that's why we run it on one tick it is slower it's a fine tooth comb but is highly accurate just trust me highly highly accurate but you don't want to run high one tick on live because it it it'll mess you up let's run it in standard live high one tick for the back test and i feel like i can trust those results uh when i run my yeah live right yep did you guys see what happened here it wasn't losing on wednesday when i turned on friday it started losing on wednesday does anyone know what happened what you might notice was this was set to three and it freaking changed to one i'm not gonna run it one more time i don't know why the latest version of ninja trader randomly changes that value i'm not sure why it does that if you're not paying attention that'll mess you up too that can be frustrating uh i wouldn't say it can be i think it definitely yeah yeah yeah definitely is you uh let's see what else what else what are the questions you guys have for me did you um thomas did you get your uh uh yeah i think so i'm doing a screen share loaded yeah yeah yeah this is still running so i'll yeah good yeah all right uh the one i have here is the volume bot this is the back test can you see it okay yeah did you run this on the high one tick by the way yeah good question yeah i did yeah it's one uh that's one minute oh yeah well that's right and i'll just screen share quickly and show you one of my uh analysis all right can you see my strategy it says market analyzer dave is that what you're trying to it says analyzer though oh sorry strategy yes and uh watch this math it's kind of interesting it was a great strategy when i loaded it right about the first may somewhere in here and then it just kind of bailed off after i load it uh scroll down on the right on the right side is it the one tick let's go down oh you didn't do one tick okay and i i i loaded this and ran it live you know based on the back test performance right and then since then it's yeah it looks like everything you did everything right it just you had some i mean you kind of you stopped you started it right when it stopped working yeah i had um i ran my mega orb probably almost four months straight and it looked similar to this and then it stopped working i had to change up some of the settings but how long does that does happen sometimes and that that was hard for me to trust uh like i did have about a week a bad week with it how many weeks how long do you let it well so for that's a good question and it's it's it's hard to give you like a straight answer but for me um i had almost four months of really good so i you know it's like one bad week isn't gonna you know i'm not gonna you know but for you you you started you know kind of at a negative so i had a little bit more history to you know because like even if i had three weeks of losing weeks i'm still up net net right yeah so um it's tough to say when you when you start negative like that but um that's a good question it was a good strategy a back test so good it should have been good and got to let it run yeah so um i would say because what i would want to look at dave is what did the back test say when you when you started it as far as your um consecutive losing trades what did that say and whenever you want to pass that like if it said four or five that's probably where i think was like two or three and then i experienced four yeah so that's probably what i want to pull the trigger like if you if you're back to um uh let's look at um tom do you want to share yours let's look at yours and i can show you an example dave on tom's uh but that i don't know when i change it it went to it's still running i don't know what's taking so long i can share the screen you see it yeah oh it's still running because oh this is you're running a vps no i'm running on my laptop oh it's still running okay well i can share my screen if you guys want why why is it taking so long it's just this is why because of the um i'll stop the share yeah it's the um the one tick okay so um can you guys see my screen right now or no you know okay so right here is what i would look at dave see where it says max consecutive winners 10 max consecutive losers 5 and then it says 7 uh long trades 5 short trades that's what i would be looking at the 5 and 7 um so like this gives you an idea of like what you could expect right so like if this is again assuming you're using the right criteria right like this right here represents 120 days right so like the best way to run this would be like the most recent 90 right so um let's say i'm just gonna let's say that it's the end of april like let's go back two weeks like pretend that we're at the end of april and i run this and it meets all my criteria right and it's like okay the large maximum consecutive losers let's just say it's five right and let's say i right out the gate i lose five well that's probably going to be it right now obviously um like most people don't understand what this number really means because what they think it means is five losers that's not what it means it does not mean five losers it means five consecutive losers and that's a little different than five losers right here's why one two three four five and then a winner and then one two three four five right so let's say i have five losers and then i have a winner and then i have another five losers and that's technically nine losers but technically i have five consecutive losers do you guys agree that that is technically five consecutive losers even though i might have had nine losing trades that still is five consecutive losers do you guys agree that that's still correct yeah that's right so that's the kind of stuff that you you just have to like think about okay have i had my five consecutive losers or not now the thing you also have to think about is if you had connectivity problems um you guys are familiar with murphy's law whatever can go wrong will go wrong sometimes you may have connectivity problems on winning days and your connections are like flawless on losing days in those cases i recommend you look at the back test to see what happened on the days where you had connectivity problems and i guarantee if you had connectivity problems on losing days count that as a blessing my friends like that's awesome like i sat out on a losing day right but but keep that in mind like keep the running tally and you know like okay like even though i didn't actually take the loss i'm going to count it towards my max losing trades and that's kind of what i the way i think about it right now in this case you'll see that i had that it shows 65.59 percent uh profitable trades but when i look at my actual trades you'll what you'll notice is some of these are 25 12 15 50 right and why do you think that is even though it shows kind of a pretty high um uh pretty high percentage profitable why is that does anyone know because of my trailing stop loss if i turn that off my percentage profitable will go down significantly it's probably like 40 percent right now keep in mind percentage profitable can be a little misleading when you have a trailing stop right because they don't count a dollar win as a correct right you know yeah but on bots that don't have a trailing stop a win is a full-size win this is counting a partial win as a win and you're not really and that's why i'm like you guys you always gotta look at the full picture look at all these tabs make sure you understand i'm taking a full-size loss but sometimes i'm making it i'm getting a 12 win like these three wins in a row don't even make up for a $228 loss right they're own a $58 win a $15 like these they're they're got four wins that still don't make up for one loss here's another $52 win understand so you got to look at the full the full picture the full package before you just fall in love and here's one that was just break even so with commissions and five dollar like just make sure you understand look through this do your homework make sure you understand what you're looking at make sure that don't just fall in love with page one of the summary right don't just fall in love with this and like okay oh it looks good the reason i'm looking at this and i know that this is automatically suspect is this percentage and this this should be significantly higher this should be closer to like five or six grand because this this max drawdown looks fine this looks good but this should be significantly higher that's why i know it should for for what the numbers look like right especially if i'm using 250 i would expect to see this these numbers if i'm using like a hundred dollars of risk but i'm using more so that's why i'm like i gotta look at the trades because i'm i can tell i'm i'm not taking some of these trades i'm not making much when i add it all up right and then look at this guys there's my five losers in a row i might have had multiple five in a rows but there's one of them right so that so they that's that's a long story short i look at what is my back test tell me and the easiest way to think about this guys um is whenever you run a bot um like some people actually will name this like this is my rick bot or this is my teddy or like give this a name right and think about this like you're fine you're filing a flight plan like a pilot would and like this is your plan right and here's what your expectations can be right now i would i don't really fall in love too much with it's to be a seven it's got to be a five for your bullish bearish long short that you know don't worry too much about this but like collectively these are your these should be your numbers right and this is what you should expect right don't you know don't fall in love with they got to break out exactly like this because as you guys know sometimes you're gonna have more bullish wins and bearish wins depending on what the market looks like right that's you know it is what is right but ultimately this is what you could what you should expect assuming you did it right and you you got a 90-day back test right so that's what i look at and if are we on plan or off plan if we're off plan it's your job to like take it offline replace it with something else and so that's that's the long answer day how do you know when to replace it or give it you know room leeway that's an answer so you're saying it should be around it shouldn't be max consecutive loss shouldn't be more than make that evaluation sorry i probably lost connection there but that's good advice right yeah i'm sorry thomas what'd you say so the max you have to keep an eye on the max consecutive loser if it's just accumulating correct but but keep in mind like the way the max losses count right like one two three four five that's five and then if i have a win that would be plus one right and then i have one two three four another minus five so net net collectively that's nine losers but it's only five consecutive right okay five and five okay do you understand what i'm saying yeah i mean it you know it's happening multiple iterations it's like a nine nine if you had um 10 if you had like five consecutive wins and five consecutive losers but you had the iteration happened twice but not directly well let's say i have 10 winner 10 losers interrupted by one winner yeah did i really have 10 consecutive losses or or did i really have five you know consecutive yeah it's like 10 no well no if i had nine i had one one winner in the middle of it yeah so it's nine no i have five losses then a winner and then five more losses but my overall account would be down nine yeah you know minus nine r so that's what i'm saying is like people would count this as nine consecutive losses no that your drawdown would be nine losses but your overall consecutive losses would be five still yeah yeah and see like the like people asked they're like hey i'm using 250 dollars of risk why am i down 1900 well because of this like drawdown is different than your risk per trade right so like if we were to look at um we're gonna pop over here to analysis oops uh daily cumulative if we're to pop over here drawdown is like your highest high to your lowest low that right there is your drawdown that is your consecutive losing trades in a row i don't know if you're not you guys know you can do this but um you guys can see like the gross losses here and you can click on each of these um um like uh dots here and you'll see you see like this little guy right here when i click around you see it moving so like when i click on a row uh the the net profit for the day uh shows up here and then the cumulative running balance negative or positive kind of pops in here i see that so like the um so there's your your losses in a row and you'll see like the balance minus 212 right here minus three and you'll see my overall balance going lower lower lower lower and then we got some more wins and it starts going back up but yeah because ultimately like what you're saying dave is you kind of started here and started losing but just because yeah um like you know someone actually told me this and it's interesting when you talk to people everyone has their own like unique way of doing it some of which are very um very unusual like i hear people say matt if i have two losing trades right off the gate i stop it and i'm like thinking to myself well like that right there is two losing trades right out the gate but it still would have made some like like why is that a thing why is that a problem i don't understand right i'm like that's just some weird rule you just made up out of nowhere and i heard someone else say matt when i run the back test the high one tick one minute and one second they all three have to match or i won't i won't use that as a as a a template i'm like oh where did that where did that rule come from like like where do you where did that come from like people have all these weird yeah i'm like that that's a really just made up out of nowhere like what yeah people have some i don't get it so anyways all that to just be mindful guys is like let the back test will do the heavy work for you let it guide your decision making um if it says you can expect five in a row and you only have two you know just be patient give it some time uh and certainly don't keep changing it up every time you have a loss otherwise you'll never give anything a chance to run you know yeah so that's that's the idea yeah did that uh back test finish thomas it's still running it did it did okay how does that look it's showing screen okay we should call this the back test breakdown what do you think it's a cool name right i asked chat gpt for some suggestions that's really can you see it yes yeah so you see where it says max consecutive is four yep yeah okay okay so are these uh have you gone live with this like how does it's okay so when did this when did you uh start running this i think about three weeks ago okay so i guess the the only thing i would say is your your um your end date then i would i would thought your end date would have been more recent like you're running through the april 17th is what it says okay i mean yeah i could just uh yeah let me test it is this supposed to be a one minute or what time frame was this one yeah one minute yeah okay because when you rerun this is going to take another 10 minutes or something yeah i mean i have this running on my um vps right and hang on i can show you the results yes i think it's this one volume by strategy it's historical maybe this one you know you see that uh yeah that's only a five day back test though right strategy performance yeah yeah were you seeing them um sorry uh how did you get to the screen again uh is just showing this right here is what he's talking about oh i see so it's only around for five days is that what you're saying yeah and it looks like uh so three trades uh three consecutive losers no uh was that the same one that uh what was the was that the same one we were just looking at the back test stuff i think so i gotta it's okay good to figure it out um because the the thing i uh because there's a a little bit of a gap between when you were like running your back test because your back test said it was run through i think 417 right yeah and then you started running it on 510 no so there's a little bit of a like like what happened in between there that i would so it's kind of i don't know if the the tests got a little bit outdated or if you ran the latest and greatest or if you sat on it it was probably a little outdated i probably had the test finished around april 17th okay because i would want to like make sure you run it latest and greatest before you like make sure it still worked okay before like right before you went live that's that's what i would have recommended okay um but you know um what about the uh the stats on the uh uh hang on because this is just zeros is that what you're on i just don't miss that it's this one you see that yeah is this okay i mean um i i would try from uh from a high level yes but i would try to get a more updated okay time frame so remember we're always looking at the most recent 90 days and this was you know you're missing like the most recent month which is the most relevant month okay right so i would do something like um i don't know two uh sorry 215 to 515 and like change up the dates and then then let's take another peek at it that's what i would that's what i would do yeah okay but i mean like right now it looks okay but we're missing the most recent time frames most recent months you know okay all right yeah yeah so if you want to rerun it and just like shoot me over the screenshot that's fine we can take a peek okay i'll do that and then um what about i guess the analysis anything you can glean oh yeah that looks i mean that's that's exactly slope in the right direction that looks fine okay all right yeah cool all righty any other questions no other questions but uh thanks matt sorry about the bad signal today but i'm glad i was able to join on hey man glad to have you in the usa yeah that's welcome to the usa welcome to oregon never been to oregon but yeah dude that's super cool you get to drive around and take a class in the back of a truck i mean dang that would make me that'd make me nauseous but good for you that's awesome i uh i really like what's going on with the so i hate to miss yeah no worries man it's all good we um i don't know if have any of you guys traded options before because we're actually going to be beefing up our options program the next 45 60 days uh more info coming soon uh that's all that's all i'll say at this moment but we got some more uh options stuff they're going to be doing um so yeah it's gonna be cool good good i need to learn more because i've traded options unsuccessfully only well that's step one figure out how to do it wrong so yeah what about you thomas you traded options before i have yes you have or have not i mean not not programmatically not to a bar okay but you have like even like manually and stuff yeah i got you awesome cool all righty thanks guys great i'm headed to chattanooga tomorrow to do my half iron man oh good luck have fun
