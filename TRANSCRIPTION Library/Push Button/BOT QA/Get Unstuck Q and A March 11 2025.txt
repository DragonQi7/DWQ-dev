Hello everybody. Hi Tracy. Hey Deanna. 

How are you doing? Are you there today? I napped for two hours. I napped from 8 30 till 10 30 and I got up and now we're here. So we're making this work.

That's awesome. You know thanks for bringing that up the other day about the time. With everybody's thought about.

Because there's other clients that are even in Canada and the United States where time doesn't change. And yeah remember that that's a very very very valid point. But so does NinjaTrader automatically adjust like do the strategies automatically? No. 

So you have so like let's say I found a strategy and I'm running a strategy on I don't know 3 p.m my time. Once that time changes I have to adjust that strategy for 2 p.m my time. Yeah either forward or backwards depending on which way that the time change went. 

Yep. It's always going to be relative to what you currently have your clock set. So if you're looking at 30 minutes before the market opened and that's what you set it at and it's let's just say that it's at 10 o'clock in the evening for you that's 30 minutes before the market opens. 

Now when the time change comes in now maybe that 30 minutes is 9 o'clock your time instead of 10 o'clock. So you do need to make that adjustment. Okay well okay might be explaining my losses in the last couple days. 

Yeah look at that. Yeah so no I appreciate you bringing that up and that like I said it's something that we never even thought of because it doesn't apply to us right. Yeah yeah well I'm apparently I'm really good at bringing things up that are just random. 

It's that's good. Like I said there's people that live on mountain time because I know that there's a section in Canada in mountain time where they don't change time. So sometimes they're an hour ahead of me sometimes they're the same time as me sometimes they're an hour ahead sometimes at the same time. 

So those are going to be the the clients that are going to have to make sure that they go back double check their their if they optimized any settings before the time change they'll have to make those changes after the time change. Yeah okay I'll make a note. Yep so thank you. 

You're welcome. John how's it going? I see you you were able to make it today. Oh no no camera no mic. 

He might not be connected. How you doing Troy? Very good how are y'all? Excellent excellent and Cindy how are you today? Doing okay yes very well. All right cool. 

Well today is just a Q&A. Q&A get unstuck. So I have nothing planned this is simply for you guys to jump in jump out whatever you want ask whatever questions that you would like some assistance with and I will do my very best to help you. 

Okay I'll go. I have plenty of questions so you need to make room for someone else's questions. Yeah we kind of addressed this in the chat but I thought I'd bring this up. 

Not really a question about the feeling I feel like your microphone's kicking in and out so I don't think I can hear you now. Can you hear me now? Yep okay. I feel like this process is supposed to be very objective very mechanical but I often find myself being stuck in kind of like subjective troubleshooting or I told you how I feel like I can't really trust many things. 

For example the VPS the connection between NinjaTrader and the VPS doesn't work which to me is very frustrating because the whole point of getting the VPS was to not have to babysit the trade all the time as it happens right and then I feel like I run into really random issues with the bots. One of the examples was a 10 ma EMA in that weird time frame that I you know that wasn't taking. So I feel like it my expectation was to step into something that was pretty black and white and I feel like I'm very much stuck in the gray and I don't know how to get into the black and white or maybe my expectations were wrong and I just need to like have faith in the process and keep pushing through and fixing all these little snags that I feel like I'm encountering. 

I'm going to go with that option right there because number one technology is never going to be black and white. There's always going to be issues when you're dealing with technology so that has to be an expectation and an understanding going into this. There's no perfect solution. 

There are always going to be glitches. You have to work around it. It's like I've used this before but consider it like a referee on the ice. 

You never know what they're going to call sometimes and sometimes they help your game sometimes they don't but that's the whole point of following the process. If you come into this with the expectation that you're going to be profitable right out of the gate that's where you're going to get frustrated and run into problems so there needs to be a time where you're just focusing on the process and you're ironing out these kinds of little glitches and the other thing that you need to consider is that every single individual has so many different variables. The way that you use the bots, the way that you use your technology, the way that you set your computer up all of these things are different than the way maybe Troy does it, the way that Cindy does it, the way that John does it, the way that I do it and so what ends up happening is when we go to test things we can't test every possible variation of everything that comes up so sometimes like the time zone thing that you brought up would never even have thought of it. 

Somebody in our community has probably been struggling with that and they never once asked the question about it so because they never asked the question it never even dawned on us that this was the issue they just probably kept going pushing through getting frustrated and then they end up either quitting or just get frustrated because they keep doing these putting these optimizations through and then it didn't work I mean eventually it would but for a month or two they might just get frustrated and if that's all they gave themselves then you know what I mean like it just you don't iron that through. Now the one thing that I do want to point out here because Fitlana just pointed this out this this afternoon she had been given some settings I want to show you what to do here you guys can see my control panel right here if you go into tools and then go to options and in this options tab go to strategies and then go down to on connection loss and update your settings so that they look like this now I don't have a lot of issues with the connection thing I've definitely I mean but I have a process where I restart it every single day but I just updated mine to this now she pointed out that somebody else she doesn't know where she got this from but somebody else had done this and she said that after she did it she's having very very few disconnect issues so that might solve your problem you'll want to update this on your vps as well as on your desktop okay so handling you want recalculate you want disconnect delay seconds 10 seconds number of restart attempts 999 and restarts within x minutes one and then hit okay okay and we'll see if that solves that issue okay perfect next the other thing that I want to say is that I also know that you're trying to make the 10ema work right now for you and I encourage you to stick with the easier bots for now until you you've got a process that's why we start with the orb and the snap right off the bat just to give you some practice you're not focusing on the multiple strategies you're not focusing on those types of things just work on making sure that you're getting the the orb and the snap kind of you've got the process down now you will be able to find options for both of those that that will work and like I said the idea isn't to necessarily be profitable the idea is to make sure that you understand how to find back tests that you can trust the technology that you can you get into that process that's going to build that trust and as you become more comfortable with that then you can start going into those more advanced strategies so my favorite bot up until just recently was the orb that's the one that I used almost all of the time and I've just in the last probably three months started using the 10ema a lot more and the um and now the mega orb and the mega snap those are my go-tos most of the time and sometimes I venture into the nr7 but usually I stick to those ones but I spent many many months just trading with the orb it was my favorite bot it was the easiest one to deal with I had less complications with it I didn't have to think about a lot of things it was just a one and done simple and it let me okay with all the other stuff yeah okay on on that segue um I you mentioned looking at the monthly bar chart when evaluating the summary of a strategy you potentially found um when do you how do you interpret that monthly like when do you say okay everything else checks out and then you go to see what it's done in the past few months and then you notice that three months ago it was really crappy and then maybe the last two months has been doing really well so I guess my question is how much weight do you give to the monthly bar chart view once you found a strategy that everything else kind of checks out um it's a good question because I I don't I don't do a lot of that what I will do is is if something's really not working I know enough because I trade manually already so I already have kind of a an understanding of what's happening in the markets so it's it's hard for me to nail down exactly like if I was just bot trading what would I do um so I don't I can't answer the question as far as what do I put a weight on it but what I can say is that is that let's take a look at a chart for a second um I have to open a chart hang on while you're opening that chart um is there a way so when you find the strategy is there is there a way for you to tell it to only take long uh trades or only short trades or must you no okay okay why is this not giving me the option to okay so I'm just letting this load there we go and so I just have to wait for this to load so basically the what I want to point out though is that if you if you run something and let's say that you've done hang on a second let's go into because that isn't gonna help at all my bot was taking 42nd minute trades today 42nd second trades all right so if you look at a daily chart and you can see that the market has changed like you can you can see that right there you've got kind of an uptrend and you could say that we've got somewhat of a trend line right there would you agree and that trend line's been broken and now we've got this downtrend happening right yeah so let's say that you did your um optimizations and let's say that you did your optimizations for February back to November so this is the three months that you optimized for you can see that that three months is very sideways would you agree between these red lines okay so let's say that you found something that you wanted to run and so you ran it and it it was kind of working right up until this point and then right here it just kind of fell off a cliff and you could be saying to yourself well this sucks these things don't work whatever blah blah blah every time I pick something that doesn't work but if you if you have some understanding of the chart you can look at the chart go well things have definitely changed and coming into here we've now broken down so this this last little section here isn't of isn't a lot of good in this particular section I'm going to see a lot of consolidating like types of by the dip types of scenarios that are going to work and do you know what I mean like it's it becomes an issue that way where it can you can understand why the bots might not be working so if you have an understanding of how the charts are working and technical analysis and that kind of thing then you you'll know that the the data that you just went off of isn't that great so maybe the best thing for you to do is to actually find a scenario where the chart kind of looked the same so why don't you back trade this section right here right get an idea of what was kind of working there because maybe that might be a better solution for you in the current market conditions do you know what I mean so yeah yeah I don't do that I just know that because I just stick to the numbers but I'm saying that if you want to get into into the weeds and you want to actually look at the analysis you could definitely pick and choose and have a little bit more discretionary information about you know when the markets are working because this is a very similar scenario to this it looks similar right and if we're looking at patterns and we're looking at repeating data I know that this does not look like this so running three months here and then trying to get it to work like that is not going to be the same so I'm probably going to have a losing streak which is probably why I'm experiencing a little bit of a losing streak right now okay with that comes in when you're adjusting every week as far as checking what your strategy is doing every week I guess I'm getting a little bit of loss in the when do you know your settings have been getting worse I guess results have been getting worse when do you yeah I don't look if they're getting worse what I do is so what are our criteria again we look at we look at our profit and we look at our drawdown and is it four times greater is that a check right but I guess the what my my question is on a more subjective level when do you know that a strategy do you just black and white you're under the parameters you throw it out black and white okay yep so let's say you started out at a 75 that was really good for you know like a like a two profit and then it went down to threshold of two is what like 65 so if it if it keeps getting worse as long as it's above that threshold you you keep you have faith in it and then once it drops down you say okay I'm done with it yep I just follow my process okay that's my process so but that being said I also don't take I don't take things that are sitting at you know 99% win rates or 97% win rates or even even 85 or 86% if it's only got one or two wins in the entire three months or sorry one or two losses in the entire three months I'm pushing my luck as far as getting it to continue winning I'm probably running into a time where it's going to start failing so the parameters that I'm looking for when I'm actually picking is for consistency so if I was to look at this one as an example I go to my chart this is a terrible monthly result over the last three months so even though this entire strategy was profitable over over three months it was only profitable in one month and I think there's something wrong here with the yeah the the data changed on me hang on I don't even know what I had it on so it changed on me sorry you can only see your graph we can't really see the the trades of the strategy sorry I don't let me go here I um I need to share my whole screen hang on I got to create a screen share make this smaller make this smaller put this in here there we go so uh let me load up something different here load and run it um mym see what this looks like okay so what we're looking for is you know we've got these parameters that this one is four times greater I'm sorry this is four times what this is that's what we want to see I want to make sure that this falls in the right parameter I want to make sure that this falls into the right parameter but that's just the part that that's the statistics part that I want to make sure works but in the same process I'm also looking at my analysis and when I look at my monthly analysis I want to see some consistency here so I don't want to see that it's just one month that it was a lot of of wins and that was it the same token when I look at my trades I don't want to see you know all of it green in one loss right or maybe one loss right here and then all of this is green every single day was a winning day a lot of people want that because they want to experience that but when you set that up and then you go to trade it you end up with a losing streak because you probably like nothing can win forever right so when I when I see this type of a distribution this is more of an accurate distribution more of something that I would expect to see with trades especially if I was using something like the the orb or the the snapback I would expect to see a 50-50 type of of scenario but because of the way that I'm managing the risk the probabilities increase so I'm looking for that consistency on top of it and if if the consistency is still there right with the with my bots and it's still fitting those numbers then I'll leave it in does that answer your question I know well let's just yeah this way yeah if I if this is the if this is the view of the 30 days this is what my daily view looks like my trades look like if I then do another assessment and in my next the next week I see it and all of a sudden this is all red this is all red okay do you think that looks similar to this it doesn't it's changed now that's most likely going to be reflected in the numbers anyway but I my point is is that if you just focus on the numbers you're going to be fine as long as you're making good decisions right off the bat because if you're if you're picking something that is how else can I explain this if you go into this right here and you're looking for you know here's let's say that this is six thousand dollars in profit and this is only one hundred and fifty dollars loss we've got one loss on the board that's it loads of profit and you look at the you go through the numbers let's say that this is 92 okay so you got 92 this is like 14 or 15 pf right a lot of people will pick that they think oh this is great this is such a good number I could make so much money by trading this okay but my passing rate is so so far away from where these results are that I could potentially have seven or eight consecutive losses now before it actually brings this down to 50 and before it brings this down to a level where it's less than four times this do you understand what I'm seeing like I'm the the yeah you want you want consistency you want you want something that is kind of in the two-thirds of the the optimal kind of optimization but you want consistency you want a pattern that seems like repeats itself as opposed to getting lucky and get that kind of high return right away okay exactly so if I was to pick something that had a 72 profitability versus a 92 profitability I'm going to take this guy before I take this guy okay do you optimize for is your go-to the profit factor when you run your optimizations yes yes yep yep it certainly is perfect okay I will be quiet now and give the mic to someone else thank you does that does that help though Deanna what it does it does it's just as I'm I feel like I'm I I spend so much time trying to find the trades and then I come up with a portfolio and then I'm like okay how do I know this is a good match and then I I look I look at the monthly chart and then like a lot of the stuff that I found in February was just terrible for whatever reason and then as each week I have to update things and I have a bit of a bottleneck which is my internet connection and my computer's computing capability so everything takes so much time so then it's like okay how much time do I put into something that on the other hand takes so long to kind of like trial and test and and figure out and then just just kind of owning right for example I've been trading since 2020 but never in my mind did it cross that I could like look at a chart and see what the market is doing like see if the condition is changing so just you mentioning kind of giving me the permission of like hey this is where you can kind of adapt and not just be so black and white on the technology and maybe use a little bit of your own kind of personal interpretation helps for me to take a little bit of ownership of the process if that makes any sense yeah for sure the other thing is is if you just keep it simple and stick to one one bot and then only run something if you find it right and if you find let's say because the other like let me just run this quickly um let me do one and a half I tend to only be able to find single days and obviously single days a week result can impact the result because you're looking at one trade in one week right so that really changes your numbers significantly if you have one loss or one win um I haven't been able to to find many strategies that I can run over multiple days okay well let's just uh let me just do this here for a second we'll do 50 um I'm just going to run this on a let's do a six minute here I'm just randomly putting something in here just to run it because I don't want to optimize for I don't want to optimize for uh a ton of things right now it'll take too long so let's just do to 10th infinite to I'm just using the standard um orb I'm not optimizing for a time frame I'm just going to leave it and I'm going to hit run whoops I hit abort sorry let's hit run so I'm optimizing for offset and I'm starting it at 5 30. I'm looking for just anything that's going to run on a six minute for an orb and we'll see what happens what comes up and this is as simple as we can make it I've got a hard-coded 1.5 min target I'm doing it over the last 90 days plus a week and this is always slower when I'm when I'm sharing with zoom my apologies I am doing a bucket test though on all the micros so as that does its thing um one of the things that I can suggest to as well is if you just focus on one bot then if you have something that's only running over one day or maybe you find something that'll run over two days a week that's okay you don't have to find something that's going to run every single day of the week that's the other thing that you need to know and I would encourage you to to set up a couple different simulated accounts and just trade with a couple different groups because that's ultimately where you're going to end up getting to for portfolio diversity because here's the thing you're going to turn around and you're going to find some settings you've optimized you see some settings like oh my goodness there's a few different ones which one do I pick and to some degree luck can play a little bit of of role in in that because I mean there could be eight different options and if you just keep picking the one that doesn't work and had you picked any one of the other ones and it did work I mean how do you know that you you don't um but if let's say you had group number one and group number two and group number three and you ran this one was like a Tuesday Wednesday bot and maybe this was a Monday through Friday bot and then this one here was a Tuesday Wednesday Thursday bot right and this one's doing really well this one's doing poorly and this one's doing really well overall your portfolio should be going up even though you have one group that's doing bad and two that are doing really well so you offset the chances of you picking the wrong the wrong settings or having a setting that isn't working does that make sense and you can make that simply simple okay so here we have let's just look at this first guy right here so m2k 1.9 now you know you guys can hit this little drop down button right there and it's going to show you the 10 results that are inside of of here now all of these are starting at 5 30 but we've got different offsets for them and they've got different profit levels now one of the things that I've never mentioned before but when you do open this up and you see that we've got 10 different settings and you can change that if you change this down here to 30 then you'd have 30 in each one of these but what I want to point out here is that when you see these 10 and all of them are profitable that's a good thing if you saw that this one was profitable but all of these were red that's not a good that's not a good sign for robustness of that particular strategy and that that's too that's another thing that I pay attention to okay so let's see if I can find an example here see here's an example uh it's not too bad but you can see this group of 10 trades we had profitable but then we had a lot of unprofitable as well okay and if we go to mes mes all profitable mgc all profitable mnq all profitable and mym all profitable so overall this this particular strategy is not too bad now if we start looking at this 1.94 let's just right click it and take it to here again this is a six minute so I need to make sure this is changed to six and run it what else changed here just go here because that's not the same profit uh we had an offset of three did that get transferred over yes it did the time why is the I don't know why the parameters aren't showing correctly a true something didn't transfer over but anyway we'll take a look at this and if we look at our pnl we look at our daily let's go the day a week we'll take monday and let's just take monday thursday friday off monday thursday friday and run it okay let's look at our analysis we've got 18 uh the four to one doesn't quite work it's close but not quite uh 2.24 and 61 we'll just say it's close enough um for this example and we run it that's it you don't have to find something that works for monday thursday friday will you look at the monthly and share your reactions yep i will let's do that so this month is not doing very good so far and i would want to take a look at the trades as well but it's only the first week so it had a losing week right so it just had two losing trades so far um yeah so it's only had two trades in march these two and they both were losers well it's had two trades before so that doesn't mean that it's going to be a losing month um so this i'm okay with this um then the only thing i'd want to do is look at the chart and see if there's any evaluations on the chart that don't make sense but then again remember this last week has been very bearish right so let's take a look at some of these trades you know that hit a target so that looks okay hit target now we know that those last three months actually let's take a look at the beginning of this period here and see what might have caused the problems if we can see that on the market yeah so trying to take a bullish trade in a bearish market that was a trap same same thing it's trying to buy in pullbacks right and the winning trade was the bearish one right so i would consider running this like i said um i would absolutely consider running this just for that uh because like i said there's been two losing trades in a row if we end up with another two losing trades right now or one losing trade this week then the numbers are going to change drastically to the point where these numbers aren't going to work and i just pull it anyway but otherwise i'm not seeing anything that that stands out as deficient i understand why it's losing why the last two trades have lost because it's trying to buy on a it's buying buying it's just the luck of the draw it's it's trapping you right and if we take a look at the summary long trades have been terrible right cool thank you now i hate to say it but if you happen to be watching your trades and you know long trades aren't performing very well the short trades are there's nothing to stop you from canceling the trade once it posts those two trades and just cancel it if it's trying to go long so you can absolutely do that if you wanted to if you had something like this but the problem with that and me encouraging you to even do that is that what happens is the long trade actually turned out to be a winner and then you get all upset because you missed out on a winner and it's like just go with the just go with the stats but there's lots of ways you can do this and i can guarantee that many people are going to try their own thing so i'm just saying that that's there i would like us and that'll be the the iterations coming up i'd like us to be able to remove longs or remove shorts i'd like to have that option to in the bot so that's in our labs as a an option to add to each of these so it'll only take short trades or it'll only take long trades because that will make it a lot easier for adapting to market market changes yeah i think that'd be really nice yeah okay um but anyway there's something that that can be run okay mcl let's just take a look at the very first one well look at this one let me just take a look at the the time frame is still six minutes so let's open this guy up and let's look at the analysis again the pnl is going in the right direction so day of the week let's take monday wednesday and thursday off so monday wednesday thursday let's run it again didn't you say you don't consider anything less than a thousand a day i don't particularly like anything less than a thousand but that doesn't mean that it doesn't pass the criteria did i not take one what changed on these stats here hang on let me rerun this and i'll run it again see i don't know something's happening with my i need to shut this down something's not working probably the six minute i think that's not transferring over nope something's the six minutes correct just something okay so this is this is where i would say i would get frustrated because i don't have the knowledge you have to realize when it's diana air or it's something on the technology that's not working properly whenever you run into an error like this what's what's happening right now you've got to restart your ninja trader so it's either connection issue on my end it could be just uh um it could be the uh the cache is full um i just need i need to find out what these settings are and i need to take a snapshot of it so let me just do page screen because i don't know what's happening i don't know why it's doing what it's doing so there we go i grabbed that screenshot um where'd that screenshot go dang it hang on print screen okay so where does it go i printed the screen where does it go hmm interesting okay well i don't know where that goes so that sucks can't print that screen i want to know where this is so i need to take let me grab my phone take a snapshot of it that way okay right click open so what we got 5 30 start time 5 30 start time oh see and i should not have uh optimized it with a 1600 close time but i did 32 1.5 1 5 150 risk monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday mcl six minute yeah i don't know what's happening i'm gonna have to restart my restart so if it doesn't match it doesn't match i get a i'm running into an issue right now now i think what happened is because i optimized it over across 1600 which is meaning it means that it's carrying it through the through the night but i have it set to not do that in ninja trader so that's what's it's probably closing those trays out and not carrying them carrying them over so i'm getting swing trade results and i don't want swing trade results if that makes sense but but diana that's why we're here and you're welcome to send me those pictures anytime you have questions on whether or not this is a dianaism or if this is a technical issue so thank you everybody everybody does send them to me so it's it's thank you right um and you shouldn't trust technology i don't okay so let's run this again entry padding is one i don't want to do that i want to do orb be 1.5 1.5 entries one and one entry offset we'll go actually yeah let's let's just run it on miq so it takes it doesn't take as long let's do six minutes uh let's go back to december that won't take as long all right does anyone have any other questions while we wait for this i do not tracy but i i'm this is great to listen to so thank you diana for bringing all this up because i'm new to this and so it's good to see what everybody's struggling with um and i'm the queen of struggling toys so you're welcome well and i i my frustration last night was tracy i had to i had to completely reinstall um ninja trader on my computer i had that error message forever and like you said eventually it'll catch up to me it did and i when i did that i lost everything um and so i'm in the process of redoing it so it's it's honestly not a bad thing my my attitude was not good last night but today it's been like like you just said it's it's it's a learning experience and it's probably good for me anyway because i'm having to redo a bunch of stuff which is just good for me to practice so we're getting there yep so do you know where to find all your templates because i encourage you to do that is to um make a backup of your templates okay i'll do that next time i learned lesson learned yeah yeah in fact before i uninstall it i always what i'll do is i'll go into and this is a good thing for you guys to know go into your documents folder so just go into documents go to ninja trader eight and sorry what i'll do is um you can actually right click on this folder and you can um just rename it where's show more properties properties so if you just rename it or copy it and paste it and rename it to something different just you have a backup you can do that but otherwise what you just go into here and and the templates folder just copy it and paste it on your desktop okay and then that way you can always go into here and you've got your your charts so this is all your charts that you've got the templates for your charts that's all there so if you put it back in that exact same spot then when you install ninja trader again it's all there perfect thank you in skins is the color of the charts all that kind of stuff yeah just i make a copy of that okay so here we go mnq we have uh here's all the results that we came up with here's the 10 now if we take a look at just the first one and actually if we pull this up you can see what the the stats are right here if we open it up in a new tab um and this should be a six minute not a one minute so let's go here six minute okay and it just switch switch to a one minute let's run it again make sure it's on a six minute okay so this one's holding that's good so let's go to analysis the pnl is looking good i like it so even just as is it's it's looking the way that i want it to look go to the day of the week it's one particular day that's really standing out absolutely so you could just use this as a friday bought if you wanted you could take monday thursday off if you wanted if we did that let's just see if how that works run let's look at the summary on it we're above two the the loss is pretty high so let's take uh third tuesday wednesday let's just take wednesday off let's run it again we're down a bit not enough let's remove the tuesday okay so we're down to 300 to 1200 we're the four to one ratio we're above two we've got the 64 that's we could definitely go with that that's just a friday bought if we take a look at our months one standout month so i wouldn't run this at all even though march is doing pretty good so far but i generally wouldn't run this because all of the it was one month that was it where it was really good but now what we could do is we could go into this guy let's take a look at this guy let's run it so this is with a 20 minute or 20 candle offset this one was with a 42 candle offset so the 20 candle offset if we look at this guy again the pnl looks really good day of the week you can see thursday doesn't work so let's remove it for sure let's take a look at the month again it's front heavy on the the last two months so not not super good for nq on here and it really doesn't surprise me given the market conditions because remember what the market conditions are currently doing we're in a downtrend right now so i'm not surprised that this isn't that this isn't showing too good for march but i now have something that i could take friday off as well i could just run this monday tuesday wednesday let's see how this works i'm taking away the biggest winner which is friday it's 600 to 1803 so not not the not the greatest we're close to it but not the greatest but my point is you've got monday tuesday wednesday bought now right and there's also a friday bought and i didn't even do another optimization i was just looking at the two just the one from nq now if i did another one let's take a look at this guy here this is 43 so this is going to wait for 43 candles again friday super good on on this so friday apparently is the data the trade these particular or the orb around here i'd have to change and do a different um different start time maybe and again monthly this one's not not too bad okay this one has only had one um one trade of drawdown but it's had one consecutive loser let's see if what the trades are like so it's pretty scattered that's not too bad okay these settings aren't too bad actually i'd like this a little bit higher the percent profitable but it's close so that's about an hour that's an hour before the market opens that's a start time with a 43 offset and closing 30 minutes before the market closes it's a six minute we didn't even optimize for time frame we just left it as a six minute and fridays aren't too bad you can make this as complicated as you want or you can make it as easy as you want the big takeaway that i want to lay forward here is first of all you don't have to trade every single day you can be very profitable with with um one or two trades a week if that more is not better sometimes less is more um and you only need to make it as complicated as you can handle right if you're getting stressed about it dial it back look for one one thing that's it focus on one ticker even so then if one ticker starts being random then everything just falls through no but my point my point though is that you need to be focusing on the process so if the process in itself right now is too overwhelming and it's too frustrating and you don't have a down in place then scale it back okay right um complexity of the time change so the three months were up until last sunday let's say if for this week the time has changed and all my strategies have to be set one hour before how do i run a three month like result if now i will have one week that's a different time change and then does that make sense how do i handle overlapping it won't because it's it's not the your results aren't going to be different like it's not going to be this this gap of time the time is going to be the time because it's eastern so the the chart's going to show you the same time right now period so if you if you were to look at 30 minutes before the market opens in your chart it's still 30 minutes before the market opens that hasn't that hasn't changed like um how do i explain this um okay one second let me let me make sure i understand so i have my strategies that i have found and i've ran before the time change as of this past sunday yep for this week on until my time catches up with the time change i need to set all of my starting time for my trades one hour back correct yes okay but when running the results for the past three months do i just leave it at the original strategy time or do i run it with my current time no you'd run it with your current time and the system adjusts for the time change in the past yeah because there's yeah i i don't know how to explain that any differently it's just the you're now because the time is still the time like on the chart it was still 30 minutes before yes your clock says that it was at this time was the open but that's not the case it's now so i just run the past three months with the current one hour set back to adjust for the for the time change yeah try it and see what happens that's what i'm gonna say because i can't test that i don't have a where i can test that because my time yeah changes so so yeah test it and make sure it's working and that's basically the message that i sent out is you're gonna have to make sure that whatever you've tested works so change the time like if you run that test now and it doesn't work technically it's saying well if you're running this now it's running an hour later than it should be running like like what i guess what i'm trying to say is if you were to look at your charts there isn't going to be this gap of time where there's all of a sudden an hour where there's nothing showing to accommodate for the the change in time do you know what i mean so historical data is is going to be based on eastern time or or central time wherever the historical data is coming from it's presenting that information on your chart based on your time frame okay do you understand what i mean so if you were to look at a chart last week you would probably see it and then compare it to this week you'd see there's a shift but the information is not different it's just presented on your computer differently okay do you understand what i mean yeah yeah because the historical information is carrying the data the time and whatever your computer is displaying it a specific way okay do you know what i mean so yeah since it auto corrects but when when you ask about the bot setting if you set a start time of say 5 30 that's two hours before the market open an hour before the market opens but i'm on mountain time and now mountain time changes and now i'm the same time that means that i'm actually i'm actually opening two hours before the market opens now do you know what i mean because i because my time frame has changed and i didn't update this so the my computer is going to see the time see the information going okay well at this particular time this is what happened but that was in central time and i'm only one hour from central time now or i'm two hours from central time or whatever the difference is now it's different so the way that my computer is going to present that to me is going to be different if i took a snapshot of what it looked like last week versus what it looked like this week you'd be able to see the difference okay i hope that makes sense yeah yeah yeah yeah okay thank you okay and all i all i can leave you with is make sure that you double check everything before you run it whenever there's a time change anytime there is a updated bot anytime there is a time change i would rerun or a contract change then i would recommend rerunning your optimizations to make sure that everything works okay those are the three things that are going to cause discrepancies i would also say if you change data providers as well that's another one all right any other questions hopefully you're not more in the mud now than you were before you came i always feel better after talking to you tracy oh thanks diana okay no other questions how about how about troy troy you already said you're good cindy how about you no i'm good i just i'm learning a lot from dan you're this is your entertainment that makes me feel so much better no i'm still so lost yeah my uh my focus today has been to try to get something organized to track everything yeah so but your spreadsheet is like way beyond my skill level so i'm dialing it back but seeing what i need to know yeah google sheets works great i think that's the one that i started with the longest time i just used um i use option or notion now because it's tied in with my trading journal so that way i can i think i'm gonna i'm gonna try to make something in notion to to do it but you track like everything i i'm trying to just figure out what i really need to know yeah cindy this is going and i'm a little embarrassed because this is being recorded but i got so tired of just all of the manual work literally what i've been doing is i take a spreadsheet i write the strategy and then i take a snipshot of the summary of the once you run the bot and then i just like put picture by picture by picture and then i compare weekly because i'm more of a visual kind of like picture side by side and then that eliminates having to input because i'm i'm not like tracy i'm not very handy and very automated when it comes to that so i just literally have been putting snippets side by side to just control it over the past few weeks and it's been working for me i might try it thanks well you you know that you can go let me just find it now this is what it'll look like um where did i say that was just open there we go so you know you can just export it right yeah but then you have to take this data and have to combine with your other data and then you have to you know yeah i'm just saying you can you can just export it too and it and it's there and you can create multiple tabs along the bottom you can copy and you can paste it so if you if you grab just the information that you wanted you can definitely grab that so here's the i want this information i want this whoops i want this this this and this i can just control c and then copy and paste it into whatever so that is just another option that you have you can save all of these as well and you do that simply by um right clicking here and then going to export and then saving it okay the other thing you can do because you can do that on any page by the way you can do that even in the analysis you can right click and you can export and i'm going to export that and then i'm going to right click and i'm just going to go to open and that's going to show you what the monthly it doesn't show you the chart but it shows you the monthly like any of these will will do this okay the other thing is if you go into here and you right click and export okay and then this is going to show you what you're again it's not going to give you the reports but it's going to export that data okay um let's see what else can you do you can print it you can share it that didn't do anything okay well anyway that's that's the option for you so you can quickly do that if you wanted to and if you got into some automation you could probably automate that as it went into an excel spreadsheet you could probably automate it so it automatically puts the data into where you wanted it to and then it's all i want your brain so all righty thank you so much tracy my pleasure i hope hope it was helpful yes always okay you guys have a good day and i will talk to you guys later good night
