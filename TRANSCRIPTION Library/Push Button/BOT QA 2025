(0:03) All right, well, this will be a, this will be a short class if there's not a lot of questions, (0:07) so we'll, we'll open it up with some questions. And then I do have one thing that I want to just (0:10) get in the recording because somebody else asked it that can't attend. So, (0:15) how are you guys doing? Do you guys have any questions? Anything you want me to go over? (0:21) I got one about the 10 AMA, but it's like, we can do that after our attendance.
(0:25) Okay, well, we, we can do it now. (0:28) Okay. (0:29) Yeah.
What's your question? (0:30) Well, I, I really want to, cause I, I, I pretty much got the mega snap and the mega orb kind of (0:39) down and I really want to start diving into 10 AMA and let me load it here. And basically (0:49) when I'm doing my backlist, like every time I, you know, I'm optimizing it, it takes like (0:55) four or five hours and I'm like, well, I must be trying to optimize something that's like (1:01) recommended not to optimize probably like the 10 AMA that the fast AMA and the slow EMA, (1:08) probably those. But my, my question to you is like, what's like the standard, (1:16) what, what do you start off with first? (1:18) Gotcha.
Do you, do you want to share your screen? (1:20) Yeah. Let me quickly just share a screen. (1:35) Entire screen.
There we go. All right. (1:41) Awesome.
Okay. So if you want to open up a strategy analyzer, yeah, there you go. (1:49) Okay.
(1:50) All right. So I always start by optimizing the musts. (1:59) Right.
(2:00) So to cut things down and the only time I'll ever optimize additional things is if, (2:06) if I don't get the results or if I don't find results that I'm looking for. So (2:10) right, right off the bat, I never optimize the day. (2:15) Okay.
You leave everything true. (2:18) Yeah. I leave, unless I'm looking for something specific.
So for example, (2:22) if I have a strategy that I've already optimized, that's good for say Tuesday, (2:27) Thursday, and I'm specifically looking for something to fill in the Monday, Wednesday, (2:31) Friday gap, then I would just set the Monday, Wednesday, Friday to true and take the other two (2:37) out. That's the, but otherwise I don't optimize it because it just slows things down. (2:43) Right.
So it's, if it's basically slowing or if it's better to eliminate some days because (2:49) of percentage profitability, basically like the things you're looking for here, (2:53) yeah. As long as it's meeting our requirements, you would keep those days active. (3:01) And if they're there and there's a day or two, that's like really messing up what you're looking (3:05) for, for the percentage profitable and net profit, you take those days out essentially.
(3:11) My initial optimization will always have true here for all the days. And then it's through the back (3:18) test that I will eliminate. Right.
Those days. Yeah. Okay.
Nice. I never optimize this one here, (3:26) futures. It's either I'm trading futures or I'm not.
So if I'm not trading futures, (3:31) then this is set to false. If I'm trading futures, this is set to true. (3:34) No answer.
Well, I'm always trading MES, MNQ. Yeah. Okay.
I never optimize risk. (3:41) Right. So you just leave it at, so whatever your risk for that account is.
(3:45) Yep. And this is the same for every bot. I never optimize my risk.
Okay. Yeah. (3:52) I never optimize lot size.
Right. I just set it to max. And if I'm trading something like my own (3:59) account, I'm not trading with a funded account, then I just set this to a high number and I leave (4:04) it.
Right. Optimize it. Because my risk is going to control my size.
So I really don't care. The (4:12) only reason we have it there is to prevent you from taking more contracts for the funded accounts. (4:18) That's all.
Right. Exactly. Yeah.
Now, profit taker, sometimes I optimize this. I don't always (4:28) optimize it. Sometimes I just set it to two or I just set it to 1.5 or I just set it to three (4:33) and that's all I do.
Right. I don't necessarily optimize it. So that's one of the ones that's (4:39) not a gotta have.
Right. It's one that you could do later. I kind of like the three.
Okay. So just (4:49) keep in mind that the higher the profit factor or say the profit taker, the higher the risk reward, (4:54) the lower your percentage profitability is going to be. Right.
Okay. That makes sense. Yeah.
So you (5:00) just have to make sure that you're prepared for the risk. That's fine. I got it good.
Yeah. Okay. (5:06) Stop loss padding.
I never optimize this. I just set it at five. Generally, (5:13) sometimes in high volatile markets, when I'm not finding any good results, I will change that to (5:18) say 10.
I see the padding. But that's in high volatile markets. Now, how do I know if I'm in (5:25) high volatile markets? I set up my market profile or my market analyzer and there's a video inside (5:31) of the Ninja Trader course in our community that's called the market analyzer.
And in there, (5:38) I show you how to set up an ATR, 256 days or 246 days, and then an ATR seven. (5:48) Basically, what it does is it compares the average true range of the last 256 days. Yeah.
(5:55) And the current average true range of the last seven days, seven days. So let's say, for example, (6:01) the MNQ has an average range of 461 points over the last 256 days, but right now it's sitting at 260. (6:12) Right.
That means that the range is shrunk, right? It's lower volatility, lower volatility than (6:17) average. And if this number gets above this, then I know that that I know that volatility is (6:23) increasing. So that's going to reflect needing more room, I'm going to need possibly more, (6:31) more space, right? I'm gonna have to reduce my, my timeframe, because I'm not going to be able (6:36) to get the same position size, all of those types of things.
So I've used that to determine my, (6:41) my volatility. Oh, my gosh, I'm going to use that after this. I didn't know there was that thing.
(6:45) Yeah. Okay. So if it's like lower than average, you just leave it five.
(6:49) Yeah, if it's lower than average, but if I'm finding it really, if I'm getting a lot of (6:53) whipped out trade, because the volatility is just really high, then I'll, I'll adjust that to 10. (6:59) Right. So very nice.
So I use that. That's but I don't optimize it. I just make that as a hard (7:06) coded change, right? Like five or 10 kind of thing, whatever.
I never optimize the candle after (7:13) I just leave it at five. Right. I never optimize the entry tick, I just leave it at one.
Right. (7:19) That's it. Because these are designed as breakout strategies.
I want to actually break out not just (7:25) touch the top of the candle. Exactly. Yeah.
Okay. So I leave that as one. Now, (7:34) close trade, you don't optimize that.
And I just leave my start time and my finish time (7:38) where they are. I do not optimize for an entry candle offset for the 10 EMA. (7:44) Oh, really? Because the 10 EMA, the only reason that this is useful is in the orb, (7:51) because the orb is a fixed time.
Yeah. So the 10 EMA starts looking for a trade at a specific time. (7:59) Right.
So all you're doing is changing when it's going to start looking for the trade. (8:05) Right. Well, I would rather just hard code that, then optimize it.
So I will do (8:11) a test that starts at, so in my time, I'll do 8am. What's your time right now? (8:19) Right now, it's 5pm where I am. Okay, so you're... Yeah, so 8am Eastern.
8am Eastern, (8:27) I'll usually run a test. So I'll start a time at 8am Eastern. Right.
If I don't find anything (8:32) that starts at 8am, like, I don't like the results at 8am, then I might change it to 8.30. (8:38) All right. Then I might run one at nine o'clock, and then not one at 9.30. (8:44) And then possibly one at 10 o'clock. Okay.
I would rather hard code those if I don't find (8:50) anything. Okay. So the only real reason to do this is if you're getting a lot of trades that (8:56) start here and you immediately lose.
Right, yeah. But you can figure that out by running a test. (9:05) Can you pull up a back test? Yeah.
And we'll run back to the optimization. (9:16) Like an actual back test? Yep. Just pull up any one.
We'll just quickly take a look at (9:22) some results. So you're gonna have to run that. No, you need to ticker in there.
(9:36) So let's say you've run that from, what is that, nine o'clock or 9.30? 9.30? 9.30. (9:42) Yeah. So I'm in Toronto, so I think I'm Eastern time. Yep.
Yep. Okay. You sure are.
I forgot (9:50) you're Canadian. Yeah, I'm Canadian-y. Ghost to ghost.
I'm right here. You're from Canada too, (9:56) right, Tracy? Vancouver, yep. Okay.
Yeah. That's very far. Like the time zone is a big difference.
(10:03) Oh, yeah. That's the difference of, you know, New York and California. Yeah.
Yeah. I'm from CA too. (10:11) Where are you from, Joseph? No, this is Alonzo.
Oh, Alonzo. Sorry. Where are you from, Alonzo? (10:18) California.
Oh, there you go. No, I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding.
I went to Vancouver last year. (10:26) Did you? I told you that, yeah. Are you back here now? Yeah.
No, no. I went for a workshop (10:32) last year, which was really good. Yeah.
Right. Yeah. I forgot about that.
Gotcha. Yeah. Yeah.
(10:38) Nice. Yeah. The time zone is very, very different.
I'm up at 4 a.m. (10:44) So like- At 4? So that's like three hours, right? It's three hours? (10:49) Markets open at 6.30. So- Wow. Dang. My market's open at 9.30, so I sleep in all the time.
(10:58) Well, and I teach some of the manual trading classes at 6 a.m. So that's 30 minutes before (11:05) the market opens, but yeah. That's some dedication. I would get up at 6.30 if I had to, but- (11:12) It's nice because I'm done by 9. You're right, actually.
Yeah. Yeah, you are. (11:16) I have the whole day left, but all right.
Well, this MNQ takes a while to do this. (11:21) Let's just give it a second here and we'll- Yeah. I should have changed to minute instead of tick.
(11:28) Yeah. It's okay. It's not a big deal.
So basically what I'm trying to get- Here we go. Okay. So (11:34) now what I want you to do is I want you to- Oh, you stopped it.
Okay. Gotcha. (11:40) No, no, no.
It's still running. I just made another tab. (11:43) Okay.
Gotcha. (11:43) Because this is going to be way faster. Oh, sorry.
It's going to be way faster. Okay, let's go. (11:52) Okay.
So now what I want you to do is go up from summary. I want you to change that to analysis. (12:01) And then if you go to where it says daily period, go to day of the week.
(12:09) Then once you do day of the week, now you can go back up to day of the week (12:13) where it says day of the week and change it to half hour. (12:19) Okay. So now over on the right-hand side, you're going to see exit time.
(12:24) Yeah. Where it says time-based, (12:26) you'll see exit time. And then if you click on that, you can also change that to entry time.
(12:30) Okay. Oh, yeah. Exit time, entry time.
(12:34) And entry time, right? So if you have a test like the 10 EMA strategy (12:40) and you see that, okay, it starts at whatever time, and you see a lot of red happening right (12:46) here, you can check to see, okay, is that exit time, entry time? Like what is it? And if you (12:51) have a lot of exit time happening in this period, well then, you know what, just get rid of the 930 (12:56) and start looking at 10. Right. Exactly.
(12:59) Right. Now in this particular strategy, you can just stop it at 10 o'clock. You don't have to (13:04) continue.
Right. So basically, cut this 13 down to 10. (13:10) Yeah.
Essentially. (13:10) So instead of optimizing the 10 EMA strategy, the entry candle offset, you just run your test from (13:18) what's the start of where you want. So like I said, 8 a.m. Eastern, you can start there and go (13:24) till the 3.30 Eastern, see what it looks like, go here, remove the days.
Well, I'd do this first and (13:32) see kind of what days or what timeframes don't work, adjust your time and then remove the days (13:37) of the week that you don't want to move. Right, right. (13:40) Or vice versa, right? Yeah.
(13:42) Because that might even improve the day of the week for you. (13:47) Right. Exactly.
Because probably most of the days are bad because they're running after 11, (13:52) after 12, after 1. Possibly, right? (13:55) So that's just one way you can do this instead of optimizing it. So now, (13:58) if you go back to the optimization page, okay, so don't opt because that takes a lot of time (14:07) to change that. Now, the next thing is the use trailing.
I never optimize that. I always trail. (14:17) It uses an average, sorry, this one here uses the tick trail.
I always trail. (14:24) And so I don't optimize the trailing start. I start at zero.
(14:31) So I do this. Oh, so you literally do this? (14:34) I hardcoded zero, zero. Yep.
So what that means is it's literally going to start trailing (14:39) immediately. Immediately. Wow.
(14:43) Now, it may trail, like, let's say that your stop is 50 ticks below your entry, and it may have (14:51) a result because I do optimize the distance. It may be 100 tick distance. (14:59) What that means is that the trail actually isn't going to start until you're 50 ticks in profit.
(15:05) And then it'll drag it. So it's not going to move the stop any further away than where you (15:10) currently are with your stop. But once it gets that 100 tick distance, then it'll start dragging (15:17) your stop along with it.
So I always start at zero. I optimize the trailing distance. (15:23) Now, when I optimize the trailing distance, I do a distance of 50 (15:28) up to 400.
And I do an increment of 25. That's going to speed things up drastically. (15:38) And sometimes I'll even do an increment of 50.
Really? Okay, that would probably make it a (15:46) little faster. Way better than doing one. Because if you did 50 to 400, you're doing 350 iterations (15:52) times all the other iterations you're doing.
So this way, you're only doing 20. So it's a huge (15:59) huge difference, right? Okay, yeah. Next is the EMA period.
I do not hard or I do not optimize (16:08) this. I just I'd leave it set at it's a 10 EMA strategy. So leave it at 10.
Yep, leave it at 10. (16:15) Now if you ever want to play around with it and see if there's something at nine or 11, (16:20) then what I would do is I would, I would just leave everything default and just optimize this (16:26) to see if you find another EMA that you kind of like using. Right.
I leave it at 10 EMA. That's (16:32) what it's called anyway. Yep.
Because there is what I like the I like the 100 EMA, you're not (16:37) going to take as many trades. And I also like the 21 EMA. That's those are two other EMAs that I do (16:44) like, but I don't optimize it, I would just hard code it if I wanted to, to try them out.
Right, (16:50) right. That's kind of like the mega scalper. I think the mega scalper has those EMAs.
(16:54) It does, because I use them a lot. So the 100 EMA is the default is just a trend. Yeah, (17:01) that makes sense.
Yeah. So that's, that's pretty much it. So that would save a lot of time.
Now, (17:07) show volume, you would not optimize that it's either set to true or false. You don't need (17:11) to optimize that. It's just a visual thing.
Right? Okay. So yeah, okay. So no need to optimize that.
(17:17) So that's going to slow things or speed things up. And I think that's about Oh, the then the (17:24) minute value, or do you optimize that? I will. So if you set the said, yeah, (17:31) optimize data series.
So right here. Yeah, there you go. (17:35) But I will optimize what makes sense.
So I'll optimize the minute I will do say, (17:42) for MNQ, how much risk are you using 250? Yeah, I would, it would be 250 would be my standard, (17:49) I would try to find something for 250. Because most of my accounts are 50k accounts. And then (17:56) I do have like a couple 300k accounts, but most of them are 50k.
(18:00) Yeah, so I'll do generally on the on the MNQ, I would generally do like three minute to 15 minute (18:08) for 250 risk. Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah.
And then you can do an increment of one, but I'll (18:14) sometimes do an increment to two or three, because I really don't, right, don't need it. I (18:19) just want to speed things up. And yeah, that makes a lot of sense.
Okay. And then I leave it at that. (18:26) That's about it.
And then you just change your look back period and your dates and everything (18:31) else. But that should speed things up drastically for your optimization. All right.
Oh, my gosh, (18:37) this is so helpful. May 1st, May, June, April, be April 1st. And you'd probably (18:53) I do it with high.
(18:56) I take one. Yep. Really? You? Okay, because you're trailing is by tick.
Yeah. So that makes (19:03) sense. Yep.
And I would also do the maximum. Yep. Change all that as well.
Now the reason that I do (19:09) the high tick one is because that's the most granular data. And if you've got a lot of (19:17) you're going to get decent results if you don't have a lot of close candles. (19:22) But if you have a lot of candles that look like this, so here's your let's just say this is a (19:27) bear candle closing above the 10 EMA.
So here's the 10 EMA. And you have a lot of candles that (19:34) are engulfing this, the standard is never going to tell you whether or not the low got hit before (19:41) the high. Yeah, that's right.
You need to tick the tick data to tell you where everything is. So (19:49) sometimes this will tell you that you got in and then you got out, but it could have easily just (19:53) gotten it could have gone down first, then entered you into the trade, and you didn't actually get (19:57) stopped out. Yeah.
So that's why you do the high tick resolution, because you need to know that, (20:05) but it's not going to be an issue. If you don't have a lot of candles that are like this, it's (20:10) only going to be an issue on trades that are like, like that. So that makes sense.
And that's why you (20:16) can get some drastic differences with standards. So what you could do if you want to speed things up (20:22) is you can run it on standard, see if you find a test, and then quickly run it on the high tick. (20:28) But if the results are so drastically different, then I would just rerun the entire optimization (20:32) with high tick resolution.
Yeah, especially for this strategy, because it's trailing by ticks, (20:37) I would just have it run one tick data. Yeah, that way I know I'm getting actual, (20:45) like an actual, you know, (20:49) cold. The trail is not going to adjust until the candle closes anyway.
So that's not going to be (20:54) that big of an issue for the for the trail. But it will make a difference on whether or not you get (21:01) it's those, like I said, those close candles that hit both your stop and your target in the same (21:06) candle, but you don't know which one was happened first. That's, that's the issue.
Right. That makes (21:13) a lot of sense. Now, because like, my profit factor, let's just say my profit factor, I hard (21:21) coded to three, where is it? Your profit taker? Yeah, profit taker.
Yeah, the profit taker, (21:28) I hard hard coded to three. I saw in some other videos that you could optimize for max (21:37) profitability, or net max net profit. What would you in this case that I chose like a higher target, (21:46) like a three? I always use profit factor still.
Oh, really? Okay. Yep. Yep.
Because the profit (21:53) factor basically is telling you for every dollar, this is what I can get for return. (21:58) Now, one of the other things that I will always look at is this guy right here, which is the (22:03) the ratio of average win to loss. So this number right here, I would like it to be as close to (22:12) my profit taker as I can get.
So if I have a three profit taker, then I would like to see (22:21) as a number as close to three as I can get. If I've got if I've got like a 1.3 here, when I'm (22:28) going for a three profit taker, that's not very good. That means either I'm getting trailed out a (22:34) lot.
And I'm not hitting a lot of my targets. Right? Right. So you'd want as close as possible (22:42) to that.
Three, if I'm higher than the three, what it means is that my trail is trailing my losses, (22:50) and I'm hitting a lot of targets. So I'm not getting a lot of full our losses. (22:56) Right.
Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Okay, so you'd still just leave it optimized on profit (23:02) factor. Yep.
Yep. Because that still tells you for every dollar that you're risking, (23:07) what you're kind of what is your expected return? Right. Right.
Okay, so I'm going to save this (23:17) as like a template just so I can like revisit it later time. So you like you said you would start (23:25) at eight, try to find something. Yep.
If you can, if you if, if in the back test, it looks (23:31) like a lot of losses start at eight. And the winds start like I don't like nine o'clock or whatever. (23:38) You are you would probably just start optimizing 8839 930 until you start to see something (23:44) that starts working.
Like I said, I wouldn't even do that I would take the first test that I see (23:49) and I would look at that. I would look at that half hour by day view. Yeah, and see what the (23:55) results are and see if there's a time that it's showing is a better time to be trading.
(23:59) And then I would just adjust it that way. Right. Cut the start time or cut the close time.
Yeah. (24:08) Nice entry in the close. Okay.
Nice. So let me just save this. (24:25) Perfect.
Let me see. What? 40. Isn't that a huge difference? Right? That's crazy.
(24:33) Now, if you did this for all the like, if you did a bot, a bot group, like a bucket test? Yeah. (24:41) Now you're up to like 130 or whatever. Right? Yeah.
Huge difference. But yeah, you still get (24:47) really good results. Now you're optimizing the tick by 50.
I think you could drop it to 25. If (24:53) you want to just to get a little bit more. Yeah.
But you don't have to. Right. Right.
This is this (25:00) is going to get you close. It's going to get you some decent results without having to wait for (25:05) like time. Yeah.
Oh my gosh, because when I was when I was optimizing, it was just I don't know (25:11) why it was like, like 10,000, 20,000. Like, I must be doing something wrong here. Yeah.
Optimizing (25:19) the trail and everything. And 3R might be too too much. I tend to stick to like, I'll go for 3R (25:26) when I'm manually trading, I can make those decisions and I can pick targets.
Right. But (25:30) for bot trading, I tend to keep my stuff below two. Right.
So. So like 1.2 to like 2.5 kind of thing. (25:41) I'm usually 1.5 or two.
It's one of the two. So I code it usually. Yeah.
Yeah. Sometimes I'll go (25:48) for more. There's times where I've gone for three, but I tend to like the consistency better with the (25:54) two 1.5 and the two.
Right. Yeah. Not sure if you're seeing this.
Oh, yeah. It's going fast. (26:02) Yeah.
Thought my computer could handle it, but. (26:06) I think I was trapped. Oh, my gosh.
Yeah. Like two minutes. Oh, my gosh, Tracy.
(26:15) Piece of cake, right? Piece of freaking cake. All right. So now let's open up the first one.
(26:25) Let me open it on a separate tab. Yep. And that says what? 3722.
Yeah. Just open it up in a (26:31) separate. That works, too.
I'll go to now go to your analysis page and let's go to the day of the (26:49) week. Day of the week. Yeah.
OK. Right off the bat, you see that that, you know, Wednesday, (27:02) Friday are kind of the best. But let's before we change anything, let's now jump up to the half (27:06) hour per day.
How can I hide this from day of the week? Change it to half hour per day. (27:14) OK, so day of the week to half hour hour, half hour per day or half hour of the day, (27:20) half hour per day or half hour of day. OK, the second that's the hour of day.
So go to the one (27:26) above it. Yeah. Half hour.
OK, so now right now you're on exit time, so let's change it to entry (27:35) time for a second and see. It's kind of a mixed bag, but go back to exit for a second. So right (27:44) off the bat, we know that we can just eliminate the eight o'clock so we can change this to 830 (27:49) as a start time.
Right off the bat. So let's just change that and run it again. (27:59) 830 and then run it.
Yeah. So that changed quite a bit, actually. So let's go back.
That's exit (28:18) time. Go back to entry time now. Yeah.
OK. So in this particular case, again, I would almost (28:27) now we can roll it up to 930. Yeah.
930. Yeah. Yeah.
I'm saying. But you can see how it's going (28:37) to narrow down the window because the drawdown is pretty high on this. This was yeah.
Seven (28:41) hundred dollars in drawdown. OK, so now that's your entry time and your exit. Go to your exit (28:47) time now and see how that plays out.
So exit time at. Well, there's a lot of a lot of them (28:55) are holding till the end, but you'd still have some losses that are taking place, but that could (28:59) be the let's go back to the day of the week. OK, so let's remove Monday, Tuesday.
So Monday, (29:17) Tuesday weren't working very well beforehand, and they got even worse once we changed the (29:22) time frame. So those were the ones that were actually creating the winners in the in the (29:25) earlier times. Right.
So now change from day of the week back to the day, half hour of the day. (29:30) And we'll see if. So that's a little bit better of a distribution, there's not much you're going (29:35) to be able to do because that's your exit time.
Let's do entry time. Yeah. So there's not much (29:42) you're going to be able to.
I mean, you can try adjusting the start time to 11, but I have a (29:50) feeling a lot of the trades that you're getting at the end are also going to be starting at 930. (29:55) Right. Because the exit time.
Well, a lot of the exit times around here are doing well. (30:01) Right. And those are probably coming from the beginning of the session.
(30:04) The beginning of the session. Right. Yeah.
So let's take let's take a look at the the analysis (30:13) of the summary page again and see we brought the drawdown by half. Right. Yeah.
And we increased (30:19) the net profit by $100, but the drawdown got removed. But still, the profit profit (30:24) factor is not high enough. Right.
So you'd want to go to point. Right. Yeah.
So (30:33) and here. So if you go back to that summary page for a second, right here, you see that 2.39. (30:42) Summary page. Yeah.
Yeah. This one. Yeah, exactly.
Right. And it's that means that we're (30:47) not actually hitting the target a lot. I see.
I see. Yeah. So that's why you.
(30:55) Yeah, I'd run the optimization for a smaller, a smaller target. (31:00) That makes sense because 3 is a little high. Yeah.
There's this I think Matt. (31:11) I saw him one time put like a really high, like really high like return. I think it was like (31:19) five or six, something like that.
And then he changed the optimize on for max profitability, (31:28) max profitable or so basically all the tests would give you like the highest R and the most (31:37) percentage, most profitable percent winning ratio basically. And you could definitely do that. That's (31:47) another option, right? If you don't find anything, because these all have really poor (31:51) risk, like the performance, the R's are not, not very good.
The profit factor is not very good. (31:58) Yeah. Most of them are like one basically.
So again, go to go to the day of the analysis or (32:08) open it up and then you'd want to go and just do that whole process again. So go to the day of the (32:12) and I'd probably just eliminate the days this time first and then try and optimize the time. Yeah, (32:21) this is only a good on a Monday.
So I would just take, take all of the days off and just use it for (32:26) a Monday and then run it again. So that's entry time. Okay.
And then go to your, go to your exit (32:43) time again. Yeah. It's just not a, not a very good result period.
Yeah. Yeah. That makes a lot of (32:51) sense.
But some tinkering around, because I'm assuming at this point you would probably change (32:56) some fundamental aspects of the actual. Well, you also need to remember that the, the 10 EMA (33:02) strategy is a trending strategy. Right.
What kind of market have we been in, in the last? (33:07) I mean, it's, it's not really trending. It's a lot of consolidation. A lot of, yeah.
And this, (33:13) this isn't going to work in an, in a choppy market. So you're not going to get good results (33:19) in a choppy market. So in this particular case to recognizing that you may want to even try and (33:26) optimize for a much smaller timeframe.
So you might want to go to say a second chart or a, (33:33) or the one to three minute chart and just optimize that. So instead of like a three to 15, (33:39) you'd start like one. Yeah.
One minute to a three minute, and then you can optimize that. So those (33:44) are just little ways that you can change things up or, or try things. So when you think about what (33:50) kind of market you're in, the problem with that is that we could all of a sudden be in a (33:54) trending market and, and now, you know, it's not super great.
So what I'd almost encourage you to (34:03) do is, you know, if you wanted to look at the charts and you say, okay, when were we in a (34:06) trending market and kind of see some, some back tests that work really good during a trending (34:10) market, and then see some back tests that work really good in a consolidated market. And you can (34:15) always hold those tests and mark them as consolidated markets or mark them as a trending markets. And (34:22) you can always revisit those and new trending markets or new consolidated markets and put (34:26) those settings back in and see if they're working again.
There's nothing wrong with doing that (34:30) either, right? Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Like right now, I think the snapback is well, (34:36) my snapback has been doing really good, you know, out of the box, because it's just that (34:42) kind of market right now, you know? Yeah. So when, so when you look at the three months, (34:49) that's what you determine.
That's what you look at to determine what kind of market we're in the last (34:54) 90 days. If it's trending the last 90 days, then it's probably going to work. Chances are the next, (35:01) you know, 30 days.
If we're in a trending market, yeah. Right. So if we're in it, (35:08) but if we're in a consolidating market, and we never know, because at any time we can move (35:12) outside of those parameters.
But if you understand market structure, if you understand, (35:18) you know, what a trending market looks like, if it's making higher highs and higher lows, or is it (35:24) like if the last three months are all inside candles, we're not trending. Right. (35:30) Right.
So yeah, like, yeah, like, it looks like we have like, when we came down here in April, (35:43) like, well, the the back this is basically from April, May, June, right here, right, (35:48) right. So we were consolidating with high volatility, we moved into public participation, (35:53) then we had massive consolidation, little bit of move, and then consolidation again. (35:57) Yeah.
So basically, like, it's been consolidating for two months now to almost three months now, (36:07) China. And that's very different than doing this. If you go to another time, like, (36:12) go further back in the chart.
Like, right, right here. Like, that's a that's pretty much a trend, (36:20) right? Yeah, you see, this area is very trendy. Yeah, yeah.
This would have worked really well (36:27) for the orb. Yes, and also the 10 EMA would have worked probably on bigger timeframes with here, (36:34) because it can hold longer. Because remember, the 10 EMA, it's still a moving average strategy.
(36:39) Those are always going to be lagging. Right. And yeah.
So again, identifying kind of what you're (36:47) testing over, and then you might want to look at smaller timeframes for that, too. So yeah, (36:52) little tips to try if you want to keep keep playing around with it. Yeah, that makes sense.
(36:57) I mean, I guess for now, I mean, it looks like I don't know, this this is this is, this is why you (37:06) can't say, Oh, we're about to start trending, you know, you get in trouble for trying to tell people, (37:11) Oh, we're gonna start trending right now, you know, put your buys in. Yeah, no, we just hit (37:16) all time highs. Who knows what we're gonna do? Yeah, I know.
Right. I was tripping. I was like, (37:20) wait, are we an all time high right now? Yep.
Yeah, you betcha. Awesome. Well, thank you.
Thank (37:26) you, Tracy. You Oh, it's my pleasure. Yeah, you nailed this one for me.
Good. That's what I'm here (37:32) for. Does anyone else have any questions? Okay.
If nobody else has any questions, and I just want to (37:43) go over one little thing to catch it in the video. So I'm just going to share my screen. Right.
So I (37:50) get a lot of people asking me about, I've installed the bot, it's not showing that the (37:55) bots installed. What's the deal? And what's happening is this. So if we pull up a strategy (38:02) analyzer, actually, it's not the strategy analyzer, they're probably seeing it if let's just go into (38:12) here and put in a strategy.
So if we grab the strategy, and let's go with just mega orb here, (38:21) what happens is right over here, they say I installed the latest version, but it's showing (38:29) a prior version. And so they think they don't have it installed. Well, this right here is controlled (38:41) by this right here.
Oops, this label. Now I can go and change that label. (38:53) So if I was to do version 1.1, and hit apply, you can see this now says 1.1. (39:03) So what happens is, let's say that you set up some a template, and you went template and you went, (39:11) let's say, whoops, not load, let's go template and save.
And I save this as a default, for example. (39:17) So now you go and you uninstall the bot and you install the new one, (39:21) it's going to automatically load the template is 1.1, even though you have 2.0 (39:28) installed. So all you have to do with that particular case, just go into here, (39:35) change this back to the current version.
So you would go 2.0, (39:43) hit apply, go back into your template, save and save as your default if you wanted to do that, (39:49) or just remove your default file altogether. And you can do that by going into the template, (39:53) go into the save here, but where it says default, just right click and click Remove. (39:57) And you can just remove it all together.
And then it'll show the current version. (40:02) The other thing is to make sure that you do have the correct version, what you're going to do (40:08) is right over here is you're going to you're going to go to tools and then you're going to go to (40:18) remove NinjaScript assembly. And when you do that, the correct version that you do have installed (40:26) is listed in here.
So if I have 2.2, it's listed right there. And you notice mine said 2.0, (40:33) even though I have 2.2 listed, and that's because of my default. So if I now go back into, (40:42) let's just close this, go back into my strategy analyzer.
And let's go here. And if I pull up my (40:56) mega orb, which says 2.2, but when I pull it up, oh, sorry, I did that wrong again, (41:00) go into the bots. So strategies right here.
And if I pull up 2.2, it's saying 2.0. (41:09) That's because of my default. So if I go into template, again, save, and I just remove this (41:14) default. Yes.
Okay. And then I'm going to hit cancel. So I've removed that.
I'm going to hit (41:23) cancel. I go back into here. If I go to install that, now it says 2.2. So if I just remove that, (41:32) see how it says 2.2, because I removed the default.
So if you're one of the individuals that's having (41:38) this issue, and I know there's at least one, because that's why I'm mentioning this right (41:41) now. And I know you're not on this call right now. But that's what you would need to do to fix it.
(41:46) So as long as you go into your tools, remove NinjaScript assembly, and you see that the proper (41:50) version is installed, then the next thing you'll do is go to template, go into the save, and just (41:56) remove the default that you had. And then you can install or you can load it again. And you'll see (42:02) that it's the correct version.
Okay. And it's controlled right here. All right.
Any questions (42:09) regarding that? You guys all good? All good. All right. Perfect.
Okay. Well, we're past time. So (42:21) I'm going to let everybody go.
I appreciate you guys's time, questions, and you guys have a good (42:26) one. Thanks, Tracy. All right.
Have a beautiful night. Bye-bye. Bye.
