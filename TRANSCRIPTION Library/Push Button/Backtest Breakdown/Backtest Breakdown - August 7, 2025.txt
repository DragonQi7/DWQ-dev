You can go ahead and share your screen if you'd like to take a look at what you got, what you brought to class. Okay, I'll do that. So the two I have here is CL and MYM that I'm kind of playing around with for the time being.

Okay. So you like the full contract, not like the micros, huh? Well, I do micros as well. Just in this case, this was the only thing that came up in the back test.

Okay. But now I'm wondering. But here's what I currently have in my... For some reason, is there a way to make that screen bigger or something? No.

Zoom ratio. Let me do this. Oh, I see. 

You have like a super wide screen monitor, that's why. Okay, yeah, that's better. Okay, there we go.

Yeah, it's kind of cutting off a little bit of the left edge, but that works. Even right now? Yeah. Like the word NinjaTrader, I only see the E and the R. And the logo on your control center.

Okay, I'll move everything in the middle. Yeah, that's better. Yeah.

Now, just in my bucket, this is everything that I currently have in the favorites. It's kind of a mixture. Yeah, no, it's okay.

So we'll start with the CL. Okay. So it's a Monday, Wednesday, Friday, 200 risk for the time being.

And what size account are you running this against again? $50,000. Okay. So, okay.

So you're using 10 lots, huh? Okay. For CL. Yeah, yeah, that's right.

Yeah. Yeah. Okay.

So $200 risk. So it's essentially like 30R. You got 40.

Okay. Yeah, can we, let me just write down a couple things real quick, just to take notes. Because when we switch screens, I'll come back to it real quick.

So 200 risk, 2R profit taker. Okay. Okay.

And can you go to the list of trades real quick in the dropdown? Yep. Yep. Okay.

And then sort this. So we see the biggest wins and the biggest losses. Like click on the, so you can click on the title of this column here.

Click on the header of it and it should be able to sort it. Okay. There you go.

So the biggest, for some reason I still can't see the top of that. Let's see. Why is that? I'm saying original size.

Okay. So 410. Okay.

That's about right. And then hit the profit column header one more time. So 200.

Okay. Got it. Okay.

So I was just looking for anomalies. I don't see any there. So 200 and 400.

Now you're going back four months. I assume, you know that, correct? So April, May, June, and July. So, and you know what ticker CL is? I assume you might, you may or may not know, but CL is crude oil.

Yep. That's right. Black gold.

Okay. So starting at 540 and 1255. And that's Pacific time.

Add three hours for you. So I'm in central. I think you're two hours by me.

So I'd add two hours, I think. Three is Eastern. Is that correct for you? That's right.

Okay. So I'm in central time zone in Tennessee. So, okay.

Got it. Okay. So sort by the number of trade, the trade number here real quick.

Okay. So scroll up to the very, very top. Oh, that is the top.

That is the top. Yeah. Okay.

Cause I was, the thing I was noticing is you started on four one, but the four 11 is the first, maybe that's just how April played out. Maybe. It's yeah.

It does. It does not take trades every available day. Well, it is four one.

Hold on. Cause it starts on four ones a Tuesday and Tuesday. Is a day off.

Yeah. But it should have four too. Yeah.

It's always going to have at least one trade a day. It may not always have more. So that's just, I'm not sure why that's a thing.

Like you're. I noticed if I go to 50 risk, I do get, I do fill in the rest of the days. So I don't know if it's.

Oh, okay. Cause you probably might not have enough risks then. Sorry.

Can I try that one more time? And are you running? I can't see the bottom, but is it one tick or. It's a standard or. Hold on.

Okay. Yeah. One tick.

It's a one tick. Okay. Perfect.

Still didn't fill it in. Still went put four 11. So for whatever reason, I guess the couple of days where the trades are missing in the back test, try, try putting 500 in here and see if it gets a different, cause I'm noticing you're always hitting one, one in two contracts, which means you're probably on the very, very low side of, of the risk.

And I'm wondering if it's because you're below a threshold, like maybe you need like half a contract, but you have to have a minimum of one. And if it uses one, then you'd have to double your risk, right? That's why I said, let's, let's just go up to 500. That's might be the case.

And if that's the case that everything is working as correct as expected. Yep. There you go.

So two. Yeah. So that's a problem.

Okay. Good to know. So what it's saying is the risk you're using for this asset for CL is a little bit on the small side, but it's okay.

It's still okay. Right. And for obviously in this case, you're using more risks than you wanted to.

So your drawdown is a little bit bigger than you would have expected, but your profits are equally as, as large. So, and it looks like you're running it through today. So that's cool.

So the only other thing I was going to look at was what the, the last dates were for the trades. So go back to trades. What was the last, scroll down to the bottom of that? What was it? Eight, four.

Eight, four. And that's Monday. Okay.

So I'm assuming it's probably the same thing. So it trades. It's off on Thursday.

Right. So it wouldn't take today's, but it didn't take Wednesday. Probably cause the same thing.

Cause the risk is the risk is yeah. Okay. So just something to be mindful of.

I really like using the micros, which is a little bit. Did you use like a 10 to one? So I don't know if they have, do they have MCL? I don't think that's a ticker. Is that a ticker? I don't know.

I don't know if it is or not. I probably should check. It's in there.

MCL. Is it? Okay. Cause I'm curious.

Like if you were to write down these results, Like go back to the, Go back to the summary and write down your number of trades and all that. So on the display right there. Yeah.

Summary. So you got, what does it say? Against 450 drawdown. So mine is 450 and that's with CL and then change it to MCL.

Keep everything the same. And you're using 44 trades. Go to MCL.

What happens? Everything else should be the same. I'm guessing you have more than 44 trades. My guess.

You might have something like 52 or something. Cause what you're doing is you're using the E-minis. Right? Not the micros.

The, the, the, the normal features contract with really small risks, like the big contracts with little, Oh, even went up to a hundred. So it's a significantly more trades. And so your percentage profit went down just a little bit.

You went from like what? 52% to 44 or something like that. But you went from a 44 trades down to a hundred. So you got 45, 72.

And you have quite a bit more drawn on here. So I guess it looks like it just took a lot less trades. Less than half trades.

So that's interesting to know more trades and not always mean more wins. It looks like the risk became a risk reduction. Yep.

Cause you went from a $450 loss to 28, 25 loss, right? You're almost your drawdowns, almost like, what was it? Like one and a half times your, your net profit. Ideally it would be like four to one, right here. So yep.

Go back to CL. That's looking like it worked better, but also took less trades. So also means if there's a day where it didn't take a trade, now you know why, because you didn't meet the minimum criteria for risk where it would have needed half a contract, but you can't trade half a contract.

You have at least one in order to get one, you'd have to double your risk, which you've defined it as 200, not 400 or 500. So yeah, got it. Now, one other thing we're going to look at is the summary.

Sorry, the analysis tab. Yep. And then change the day of the week to daily.

Yep. And then do cumulative net profit there. That's interesting.

So what I noticed here was the biggest gains from all of this came within that first month, first four to five weeks. You see that? Yep. So the question is, can you, that's not quite the, and then for quite a few months, it went sideways for a bit in June.

It didn't really go anywhere for all the entire month of June. How many trades did it took? Only two trades in the whole month of June. No, it's got this, that it took three after that.

So on the 25th. Oh, well, okay. Yeah.

So these are like broken up by day. How many you took in a day? I got it. Yeah.

Okay. So yeah. Cause you can change the period here if you want to change it to monthly, I believe.

And it'll aggregate the monthly. Yeah. I think that's what you're looking for.

Like your net profit for June was yeah. Well, there you go. Zero.

And then, but that's what I'm saying is like the, the biggest wins happened to the there's kind of front loaded. So the question is, is, is kind of like, you know, did you get lucky at the beginning of this test and couldn't, can you bank on that? That's why what I like, if you change that back to daily, what I typically like is the kind of the slow and steady, something like this kind of a move. Right.

Where each and every trade I think you can change this, the trades. Right. Can you train that to trades? Yeah.

So like this, you just had a huge run. Huge run of, of winning trades. And then they kind of went sideways.

So, you know, I was going to say everything up to that point was decent, but that's just something to be mindful of. You know, it's, it's not, it's not necessarily you throw it away, but all this is saying is you probably were going to count funded. Had you started immediately with this, right.

Cause there's your 3000 trades, right. Took a loss than a bunch of wins. So it had a really good winning streak, but ultimately the question is, you know, it feels like you got a little bit lucky and the question is, can you bank on that every month? That's the thing to think about.

That makes sense. No, that does. Yeah.

So what else do you have? So I would give that one, maybe a B minus. Minus or C plus something like that. Right.

Just because of that. Yep. Next one.

Let's see. It's only a Tuesday. Still a mega orb 200.

706 start time. M Y M. Yeah. Same dates.

Same dates. Yeah. Okay.

And what does the summary look like? Well, you have a similar kind of thing. It was like you got up to. So you kind of got, you went from nothing to something pretty quick and then it just kind of slowly.

Yeah. Petered out a little bit. So it's similar.

Let's take a look at your, the trade. So at least this only one day a week. So how many, let's look at the summary real quick.

Yeah. Let's sort by the profit. Well, sorry.

Let's take one screen at a time. Okay. So you got 27 trades in this case and it's 24, 12 against minus two 58.

Is that what it says? Okay. Okay. So not nearly as many trades to look at only.

And it makes sense because you're only doing one day a week. Right. But you do have a high probability.

I winning. Let's see. Consecutive losers.

Three. Okay. Okay.

Let's look at the, the list of trades. And you're using the same thing. 1.4 and 200.

Right. So I should have a 200. Okay.

Yeah. So you got 200 is your biggest loss. That's right.

And then your biggest win should be around two 80. Yep. There you go.

Two 80. So again, I'm just looking for anomalies there. Anything that weird could have happened.

And obviously in this case, you're exiting at 1255. What time does the market close for you? Is it. One.

Your time. So you're five minutes before the market closed. So that looks like you get your time squared away.

Pretty good. So this one, I give it the same B minus C plus somewhere in there. I'd say C plus, cause you don't have nearly as many trades.

You only have 27 because it's that one day a week. My ultimate, ultimate favorite is if you're able to get something that works five days a week, if not five, four days of the week. Right.

That's that's the ultimate favorite. Yeah. What else? Those are the only ones that I had here.

Yeah. On the ready. Okay.

Let's see. And does, does that kind of what we went over makes sense. So like the, the first thing we talked about was the risk on the bigger contracts, the CL, why it was skipping some days.

Does that make sense? Why it. It does. It does.

It does. Yeah. Florencio.

Hopefully that makes sense. Why you got skipped. Okay.

And then the, the, like if you have a huge run at the beginning and then it kind of tapers off or just slowly increases, you know, that's okay. It's just, you had to have made, you know, you had to have been in the trades during this really huge winning streak to know whether or not, you know, that would have been like 70% of it was came in that first, you know, little period and the rest of it came in and this much more, you know, much longer timeframe, but less, less profitable. So it's just something to be mindful of.

Again, the ideal formation is something that kind of gradually goes like this, you know, kind of a smooth and obviously it's not gonna follow it exactly, but something like a smooth, you know, something like this. Kind of a smooth type thing. It's not terrible.

But I think the, the ratios look good as far as the winning trades and your net profit to draw down ratios. Those look phenomenal. You know, you were at like a four to one's minimum is, and you're at like a nine to one or 11, 12 to one.

So that was, that looked, that was good. How many days a week is this one? I didn't see. I mean, this is one day a week.

So 27 trades. Okay. Yep.

Got it. Okay. And mega or, by the way, the latest is 2.2. I know you have 1.8, but.

I don't want to update again. I'm gonna lose all my presets. That's my.

Well, so you guys want me to show you how to keep them, how to keep your templates. It's pretty. Yeah.

Pretty simple to do. I'll walk you guys through it. It's not, it's not hard.

Okay. So. So let's say that I have my documents Ninja trader folder.

And I'm going to go into my templates and go into strategy. And in this case, we're talking about mega orb. Right.

So these are all of the actual templates I have saved. Right. So these are the templates, the naming conventions I gave them.

Right. So mega orb, you'll see one. And then Peter, one that says may one that says demo.

One. This is Dr. Joe. You guys see that? So if I was to go into my actual go into, let's see one of these like mega orb.

And I was to load up my templates, which by the way, I just noticed I updated my, the VPS, not my local desktop, but here's my Dr. Joe, the Peter may demo. Remember those are the temples. We just, so like this list right here, this list of templates right here live literally right here.

And this folder documents, this is where I have them saved. You guys may not be in the same folder, but this, the rest of this is the same. So all you need to do if you want to keep these is like, copy this to your desktop, install a new version, then copy this back.

That's it. So like make a copy, right. You're going to copy this, paste it on your desktop or somewhere.

Right. Install the new version and then paste it back. Same thing.

If you're going to do, I haven't really seen where new versions of the templates are lost with the new bot update. I have seen with the new Ninja trader update for some reason, new Ninja trader updates. It like deletes all of your templates, not just your strategy, but like your chart, your apex settings, like everything gets just wiped for some reason.

It's kind of weird, but I have noticed that when you upgrade Ninja trader, not actually when you upgrade the bot itself, but no, we can do, we can do a quick experiment and we can take a look and we can see what happens. That'd be kind of fun to do. Right.

Let's see what, see what happens. So let's do that. You guys want to do that? Let's take a look.

See. Right. So I'm going to go into tools, remove Ninja trader, mega orb 1.8. Mega orb 1.8, remove.

Boom. Give it a sec to remove. Done.

Okay. Now I'm going to restart Ninja trader. Restart.

I have one running. Really? Nothing is connected. Oh my goodness.

Well, it's not connected. You guys see, I have a big red thing, meaning I'm not connected. Red.

So I'm not connected. Okay. Now I'm disconnected.

Okay. So I'm going to restart real quick. Boom.

Boom. Actually, I should double check. Is that folder still there? Strategy mega orb.

See, it's still there. Yeah. And I removed it.

The question is, is it still there? I'm going to copy. Yes. I'm going to restart this guy and I'm going to go to downloads and I'm going to paste it right here, just so I have a copy of it.

I'm going to restart my Ninja trader. And it's asking me to log in on this other screen. So you guys don't see my super secret password.

Boom. Oh, it's actually making me enter it from scratch this time. It's, I haven't done that in a while.

Okay. Let me get my password. Okay.

Let's see what happens. Should come back in a sec. I think it's opening in my other screen.

Let's see. I heard something. Where are you Ninja trader? It has not made itself known yet.

It's thinking. Okay. We'll give that a sec.

Okay. So now if I go to tools, import Ninja script add-on, I'm going to now grab, you guys probably can't see the new window that opened up. Mega orb 2.2. Where is it? It's here somewhere.

Where'd I put that? Let's see. Here we go. Where's the, where's that? Mega orb.

Okay. Here we go. Sorry.

Do it one more time. Tools, import Ninja script add-on. And go to downloads.

Mega orb has been imported. Mega orb 2.2. There we go. Now we're in business.

And I haven't moved anything yet, but let's see if, oh, you're right. My templates aren't there. Well, good thing I copied it.

Let's go to my downloads folder. Copy this. So I'm going to go back into my Ninja trader folder.

So remember, I dumped it in my downloads folder. I'm going to go back in here, going back in here, go back into strategy, go back into mega orb. Oops.

Sorry. Try it one more time. Strategy, paste the mega orb.

So now when I go back in here, there's all my templates again. Boom. There we go.

So that's basically it. You basically just copy the folder, set it somewhere, remove the old one, restart, import the new one, copy the templates back. Does that make sense, kind of, sort of? Yeah.

Makes perfect sense. Yeah. That's it.

And when I click templates load. Oh, sorry. Accidentally unshared.

So now when I click templates load, there's all my folder stuff, the Dr. Joe, Peter, May demo, all that stuff that I just had previously. So now we're good to go. Yeah.

Cool. Well, hopefully that was a good lesson. Let's see who else we got.

We got Miguel. Hello, Miguel. How are you? Anybody else have any other back tests they want me to review? Florencio, Miguel, questions? What's going on, Matt? Can you hear me? I can.

How are you, Miguel? I'm doing fantastic. Sorry for being late. What's going on? I'm pretty sure you guys should be done by now.

Just wanted to try to get as much as I can from you guys. Yeah, no worries. We're just wrapping up.

We are recording it, so I'll post the recording here shortly. You can get caught up, but, yeah, no worries. I don't know if you had a back test you wanted us to look at.

Andy brought two of us, two to us, and we kind of gave them a B minus C plus on those, but, yeah. Let me see if I could share it. Just bear with me.

Sure, yeah. There's a share button at the bottom there. Right.

I got to do it from APPS. Hold on a second. I got to log into it.

Okay. Let's see. And if you have a hard time finding it, you can just, like, message it to me, and I can look at it later.

Yeah, I'm going to message it because I did it last week, and I've been very busy with work. So, yeah, I'm going to message it to you. Hopefully you get back to me on that.

Cool. All right. Sounds great.

Cool. Well, that's all I have for you guys. Thanks for sharing, Andy, being willing to share.

Hopefully you guys learned a couple tidbits about, like, what I look for and why some of the trades weren't showing up because the dynamic sizing and then also, like, how to keep your templates without losing them. So hopefully that was worth the price of admission. So, cool.

All right. Well, that's all I have for you guys. Thanks so much.

I'll get the recording posted shortly. Thanks. Yep.

All right.
