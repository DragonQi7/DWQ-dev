Well, I know, right, it's not easy for you guys. So for me, it's too easy now. So I try so hard.

I try, I shouldn't try. Supposedly, it's natural. You guys just download it.

But I still have to try, you know, squeezing in. Because it's not easy. It is not easy to have that kind of faith to understand, oh, I'm not going to deal with disease.

What am I going to do? Right? We still worry about the disease. Because they still complain the disease. If I not treat the disease, does something going to happen? See? How do we understand disease and illness? That's what I say.

We have to be established. So that's why this morning, I try so hard. I try so hard to establish some kind of concept.

Right, the concept. So every concept, what you call it, the program, whatever, has to call the theories, belief behind. So this concept is the things that body can heal itself.

With some degree, I believe that you guys also believe. You wish you can believe. Right? I know you wish you can believe.

But unfortunately, you don't see this very often. Right? You don't. You doubt it.

If a body can heal itself, why I'm still have more wrinkles? Right? Think of it this way. If a body can heal itself, why I'm still lose the hair? That means I still not meet the requirement. Even though I practice, I still not meet the requirement.

That means something in my life, whatever what I do, still limit my energy. Still limit my millions at this area can fully open. Otherwise, impossible.

You definitely body can deal with this. You definitely certain things that can be fixed. Right? You shouldn't have this kind of condition because it's unlimited.

The power of the Marines is amazing. You know, so I saw this. I saw my master deal with this condition, deal with people's problem.

One needle, they disappear. Just one needle. Because he can see, definitely, it's much easier.

But at the least, at the least, allow me to understand, oh, that kind of power for the Marines, that miracles can happen. I give you example. The patient come in, he has a diabetic.

He has to use insulin. Has to eat all the time. So he can complain.

He say, master, does anything Chinese medicine can do? He say, yeah, it can do if you trust me, stop your insulin. That's scary. Stop insulin? How can you have a? He say, stop.

Stop the insulin. So he just do the one needle at the shoulder bone, one needle at the there. He say, stop the insulin.

How do you feel? He check the blood pressure. You know, next day, he say, oh, pretty good. Only after eat has a little bit higher.

I say, after eat, it definitely has a higher. Right? Do the next day. Two days later, he do it one more time.

Almost control. Only do two treatments. He doesn't need the insulin.

How come? How come these things can happen? Because we totally misdiagnosed as a diabetic. Diabetic. You know, that's the whole idea is people thinking they know.

We know diabetic. He say, tell me diabetic is nothing to do with the stomach issue, nothing to do with the pancreas. It's nothing to do.

## Opening — Trying and Faith

Well, I know, right, it's not easy for you guys. So for me, it's too easy now. So I try so hard. I try, I shouldn't try. Supposedly, it's natural. You guys just download it.

But I still have to try, you know, squeezing in. Because it's not easy. It is not easy to have that kind of faith to understand, oh, I'm not going to deal with disease.

You definitely body can deal with this. You definitely certain things that can be fixed. Right? You shouldn't have this kind of condition because it's unlimited.

## The Power of the Meridians — Miracles and Examples

The power of the Marines is amazing. You know, so I saw this. I saw my master deal with this condition, deal with people's problem. One needle, they disappear. Just one needle. Because he can see, definitely, it's much easier.

But at the least, at the least, allow me to understand, oh, that kind of power for the Marines, that miracles can happen. I give you example. The patient come in, he has a diabetic.

He has to use insulin. Has to eat all the time. So he can complain.

He say, master, does anything Chinese medicine can do? He say, yeah, it can do if you trust me, stop your insulin. That's scary. Stop insulin? How can you have a? He say, stop.

Stop the insulin. So he just do the one needle at the shoulder bone, one needle at the there. He say, stop the insulin.

How do you feel? He check the blood pressure. You know, next day, he say, oh, pretty good. Only after eat has a little bit higher.

I say, after eat, it definitely has a higher. Right? Do the next day. Two days later, he do it one more time.

Almost control. Only do two treatments. He doesn't need the insulin.

How come? How come these things can happen? Because we totally misdiagnosed as a diabetic. Diabetic. You know, that's the whole idea is people thinking they know.

We know diabetic. He say, tell me diabetic is nothing to do with the stomach issue, nothing to do with the pancreas. It's nothing to do.

But unfortunately, we give it all totally wrong treatment. It's the wrong treatment. We treat the cost. We not treat it. We treat the effect. Effect.

Pancreas is effect, not cost. What cost? Heart. Diabetic is a heart disease.

It's the heart problem. Because he truly understood the Marines understand real impact is the heart Marines change. So therefore, he only need to do the heart Marines one needle.

Whole things open up. Everything can change. See, once you go to the Marines, you see the real cost.

But today, we don't. Not many people can do that way, right? So all we can learn is to learn that the sentence, learn that the locations, based on that way, try to create natural processing. So this way, we don't mix up for the natural ways.

## Choosing the Focus — Liver and Stomach

So at the least, if we go down this path, the two things you guys should know. I know it's very difficult. I still try, all right? First, we say, if we shout out, we're going to use these two concepts, shout out concept.

Therefore, we chose these two organs. One is the liver organ. One is the stomach organ.

We chose this way. Why we chose this way? Think of this way. We can name many different illness, disease.

They always have issues associated with the liver function, as of today. All the blood issues, all the blood disease, you name it. Your high cholesterol, all of these blood issues, high cholesterol, and now hypertension, tendinitis, arthritis, tendon problems, and eye problems, joint problems, sport injuries, the tendons, elbows.

I can name so many eye issues today, eye, everybody, eye issues. They're all associated with the liver. No matter what you do, you can name it.

I always can tell you, you have some issues are related to liver function. So liver function, so dramatic impact to our life as of today. Not just liver function, because we can say liver function be dominated by society, by our lifestyle.

So in this kind of lifestyle, who doesn't have a liver function disorder? Think of this. How many people can say, I don't care, I can let it go? How many? Which is not many, right? You need a lot of faith. You need a lot of flexibility.

Otherwise, you cannot deal with it. You cannot deal with the stress. You can't, right? Everything's moving, moving, moving fast.

Anyone texting you, immediately you want to give an answer. Fast, fast, fast. Everything today, what we do, will cause the liver function disorder.

Everything. Whole lifestyle will cause the liver function disorder. So if liver function is that kind of so important, it's the key getting in, why not? That's why I raised the question, why not? We can use this way to return the health back, to allow ourselves gain back.

Because the liver's so powerful. Liver is one of the most powerful organs, because the heart we cannot control. So rest is very difficult to deal.

You want something more powerful? Liver is the more powerful. I can tell you, liver is the most powerful organs, compared for the kidneys. The kidneys are almost difficult to deal, also difficult to deal.

Liver is easy to deal. Think of the one thing. I'll give you the other way.

So why is liver so powerful? When you die, the spirit of the liver goes, travels. Rest, all the spirit of the organs stay here. Doesn't go.

Liver is the only one spirit can carry the other spirits in and out. Other organs cannot do this. If liver that powerful, why not? We can use for purpose, for health, for better life, right? We name it as of today, most illness and disease are associated with the liver function disorder.

Most, you can name it. Any kind of digestive system issues, always related to the liver, no matter what. You never find anything doesn't relate to the liver.

## Women and Liver Issues

As of today, how many women is the issue? Female, all the female issue are related to the liver issue. Breast cancer, urinary cancer, all of this is liver issue. So therefore, if we just deal with the liver issue, supposedly, which is many years ago, 10 years ago, when I started, when I practiced, I just started with the liver.

Rest doesn't matter, I just added in. Still, I can see the result. Because just for the liver, because everything is connected, liver is my cutting edge.

Liver is my enter gate. I through the enter, through the liver gate, think of this way, I enter to the universe. Just like here is how many doors? Which door you coming in? Right, five elements.

Which element you getting in? What element at the beginning is what I chose? I see the result, right? But to pass this to majority of people is very difficult, because not many people has a similar training what I training for the liver. For the practitioner, liver is a different kind of training. You have to be very flexible, even physical body flexible.

Forget about the emotional flexible. So your joint, every joint has to be loose. Your body has to move like a snake.

The hand has to come out any time, anywhere, nothing. The time every day, if you show this for thousands of time, you later start the joint hurts. You cannot take out the chopstick.

But you won't do this exercise. You have to open up the whole thing, allow the joint reopen it, then connect again. It's not easy.

So what do I do? Still doesn't mean I'm going to stop this, not training you guys, not pass this knowledge, because I get the benefit. Only you can do is get your mind flexible, right? At least you start mind flexible. Your body can be flexible a little bit.

How many people try to do the yoga, then you find some posture difficult to do? Sometimes it's your mind is not flexible. It's not the yoga itself. Yeah, you can see that.

A lot of people, it's their mind. They are not flexible. It's not yoga difficult, right? Then later when I said, OK, if it's difficult, then why not? We add one more thing.

## Digestive System — Earth Element and Stomach

So that's why I come out of the digest system, because digest system is the other angle of the Chinese medicine. They found a different angle to understand everything can be digest. Everything can be processed, right? Earth is a gigantic digestive system, thousands of years.

How many things cannot be digest? So if that element is related to stomach, why not? We cannot look at things as digest. So if we put these two systems together, we're ahead of the game, right? How many things, how many people today doesn't have any kind of digestive system issues, food issue, right? Everything today based on what we eat, how to eat, constantly eat this gluten-free, this free, that free, that free, allergic to this, that free, how many things? They're all about the eating things, stomach, right? So if we can, through this one, through this system, we meet the natural law of the digest system, our body will be able to manifest something. We can digest something, right? Because the stomach is the earth element.

The earth grow everything, manifest everything, nurture everything. So our stomach should have the same spirit, has same spirit, same consciousness. So just how much we can connect into this consciousness, how much we can provide our body meet this requirement.

So if we can meet this requirement, the body can heal. This whole system, using this digestive system, stomach, is a whole Chinese medicine practice for the kid, for children. So here has any doctor deal with the children problem? All they deal is doing the stomach.

They don't care the liver, because the child, all based on the food. If they deal the stomach, they deal the everything. So the whole digestive system deal with the child issues, children issues.

You can almost cure everything, almost. But that's just condition, we say. But we are not deal condition, right? We deal complicated condition.

We are not just deal one headache. We deal so many other issues together. When mass produced the condition, the patient come to you, dump in front of you all the page.

They wish you can fix the ones. How to start? How do we get in? Definitely, this concept not going to cure everything. I'm telling you, this concept will help you start right the path without making mistake.

That's the whole concept, right? Help you start right the path without making mistake. Because no matter what, you need a healthy digestive system, you'll be able to digest any kind of food, nutrition, knowledge, information, everything associated with your digestive system. No matter what, you need a flexible, you need to go with the flow, you need to allow your spirit can carry in and out.

No matter what, your life is a stress. How can you de-stress yourself? No matter what, you need this. So therefore, allow these two organs can work in together, create as the team, we're ahead of the game.

Because of this way, look like we don't deal the disease and illness. We still deal the disease and illness, but we are not focused on disease and illness. We focus on what caused, see? I want everybody understand.

What you deal, you are deal how can I enhance the body balance? How can I reach the body, raise the body capability? Let them function at the highest level. If it can function at the highest level, body can heal itself. Why? Consciousness, meridians, life source.

## Meridian Network and Universal Connection

So that's why this morning, I spent a lot of time talk about the meridians. That's you have one near the completed called energy body, automatic body called energy body, which is your meridians. Your meridians will stimulate.

By deal, now here is one of the missing information, right? Look like I'm missing because I think it's a way I'm missing. When I talk about, when I say stomach, when I say stomach, right? I have to clarify myself. When I say stomach, the included stomach organ, spleen and your stomach meridians, your spleen meridians.

You understand what I say? I include the meridians. But you not just say stomach. I hope you understand that.

So that's why it's difficult. When I say stomach functions include meridians, visible, invisible. I think visible is easier to understand of stomach.

But we are not just talk about this physical stomach, but also talk about your energetic stomach, which your meridians, your whole energetic pathway, right? So talk about the whole energetic pathway, also talk about the whole meridians consciousness. Whole meridians elements. The whole meridians, the frequency, different meridians.

It's a different frequency. Think of this as a concept. Just like a different meridians, different channels, right? You want to see HBO, it's HBO channels.

You're not going to see PBS at HBO. It's different channels. Stomach only functions stomach meridians, stomach frequency.

Understand what I say? They don't interrupt other kind of frequency. They can together create a different frequency, but each organ only function their own frequency. So that's why, as one of the unique, once you understand, you might find a very interesting concept, which is today someone asking me.

When you do the organ transplant, right? You put somebody's organ into your body, what's happening? Figure this. What's happening? No, same meridians, different body. The software doesn't change.

You only change your hardware. How can they function? You cannot function. Doesn't do same way.

My liver receive my liver frequency. I give my liver, because my liver has a particular way, can understand my liver frequency, you know what I'm saying, my liver meridians. Maybe more high speed, maybe more crazy, download a different plus, different information.

I give my liver to you, your meridians, it's slow. It's a slow internet. I'm a high speed internet.

Your liver cannot, your meridians doesn't function same way. So you put my liver go to your body, doesn't function that way. Understand? Because the meridians you don't change.

You cannot transplant the meridians. You only transplant organ. Organ is a material.

The meridians pass the information. Information, speed of the information is different. So that's why organ transplant always cause the problems.

It's a function. It's a function problem. Each organ, each meridians has a specific frequency, specific function.

So when we deal with this kind of concept, we put all of these function together. You enhance your digestive system function. You allow the body function better.

So once the body function better, you have to understand one more thing right here. When we say at the beginning, and then how do I put it, let me go back to this morning we say meridians is represent the network. The network is universal network, right? Universal network modified specific way for you.

It's your versions of the universe. Understand that kind of concept? Understand that everyone of us is the different versions of the universe, but still it's a part of the universe. So therefore, even though you have stomach meridians, you have liver meridians, each one function specific way can connect to the universal frequency, elements frequency.

However, not many people, which is not, we want to see many people have fully developed this capability, can use their capability of their meridians, not just organ itself. It's meridians. Just like I put it this way, computer.

We all have a computer. How many people can use the computer? A hundred percent. With the internet, with the software, what you have in the mic, can you use a hundred percent of what they can do? No, right? Why? See, you just use the basic thing.

I use this one. I use my cell phone as a basic diet out, diet in. Rest I don't know how to use.

It's a waste, right? It's the same concept. We have organs. We have meridians.

But we never use the hundred percent, even 50% of the meridian capability we don't use. How can we meet this requirement? That's called a challenge. That's called exciting.

I really excited this concept, because this shout out concept, if we apply good way, can apply for many, many different issues, deal many issues. Because it's unlimited. Unlimited is meridians unlimited.

Life is unlimited. But we saw the limit. We saw the organ when we can see.

We saw the body when we can see. Try to connect unlimited universe. Try to connect unlimited possibilities.

So that's why we through this concept, we say shout out. I say go to the stomach function, which is a digestive system. Here's include the organ, also include the meridians.

Right? We say we go through the liver function concept, the liver systems, right? That's also associated liver organs and the gallbladder organs and the liver meridians and the gallbladder meridians. Location, location, location. Right? I say that it's location.

So the location means location, different state. That's a different location. If in the body, which part of your body, there's location too.

Right? Your head, your chest, your back, your neck. So now you look at the location concept. That location associated with the meridians running through.

Meridians, the pathway. The gallbladder is one of the very unique, the tiny organ. Right? Organs so tiny, but the meridians are so big.

Does anyone question that? Why the tiny organs need that big meridians? Does someone make a mistake? You think at that time, God make a mistake when he create the human body? You're missing energy. You create all of these so many lines go to the head. The gallbladder touch how many lines in your head? So that means gallbladder, if meridians go to your head, does gallbladder can impact to your brain function? Have you see this way? Your brain function directly be impacted by gallbladder.

So that's why if you don't, if you're missing the gallbladder, you do have a problem, mental issues. I'm sorry. You know, if I going to hire someone, I definitely wouldn't hire you.

Definitely you wouldn't be the planning board. You cannot planning things. You never get things done because you cannot make a decision.

Do I have to go? I don't need to go. Do I have to do that, do that? You cannot make an issue, make a decision, because people doesn't have a gallbladder. Yeah, gallbladder is a very, very important, very, very important because of their meridians, right? Their meridians is so important.

The running through the whole entire body. And beside of this, the gallbladder also is the one, only one meridians and the travel your front body and the back body. That's only gallbladder can do.

So that's why they at the front and the back and they can cross each other. So that's why we say, if we say front is in and the back of your body is young, we say the liver can transfer for in and young, visible, invisible. So the meridian itself designed your possibilities.

You can do this. So many what's called exciting, you can see through the meridians, right? So we deal with each organs. We saw that these organs, we saw that these meridians, we saw that this concept, we hope.

Now within the hope now, right? Suppose the hope is for hopeless, but we still need a hope, right? We hope with our faith, our follow this natural law, the body can wake up, right? The body essence, the body consciousness will wake up. Your patients can wake up and they say, yes, I have hope because someone showed me something now, I have hope, I can do something. Because no matter what you do, you never make a mistake because you didn't treat the condition.

You enhance the body. You allow the body have chance to expression themselves, to do something more than what they can do, right? So that is the most important concept. If that concept, you have a little bit of question, you have difficult to understand, you better digest.

Otherwise you start to have a question. Do I gonna to real see the, you start questioning yourself. So if you question yourself, then you have to question whole concept.

Are you truly believe body can heal itself? See, are you truly believe what is the best way? So even though you don't believe it this way, then you still go back. How do you know your diagnosis is right? See, very simple. Amount of today we already say who you are, where you are, how you are, when you are, just based on the simple, these four questions.

How many datas? How many informations? Now, how do you know your information is right? How do you know you didn't make a mistake? So that's a very important that this, today we covered this big concept, right? It is a bigger concept. It's a shout out concept. The shout out concept will go over again, right? I need to go over again.

This concept is not a deal with a disease. It's a try to follow the natural law based on what we believe a body can heal itself as long as we meet the requirement of the each organs. Because each organ is unique.

Each organ, why they unique? Because they have two thing. They have a body part, visible part. They have invisible meridians.

Because the meridians is a network of the life source. It's the network of the universe. So therefore, the body have a chance to connect to the life source, to connect to the universe.

So if we follow the natural law, body should function this way because that is a natural law, right? That's what we say grass will grow itself, right? As long as give it a water, they grow. So why not? Body cannot grow if we meet the requirement. So all we needed to do is a requirement, right? How do we deal with this kind of requirement? How can we deal with these things? So I think I'm going to leave this, called the requirement things for the tomorrow.

We can deal with this requirement. Now we know each organs real requirement and we can deal with this. Then learn a couple very important things called how can we stimulate the meridians, right? How can we give it a positive thought? How can patient, how can ourself at a short time, we can stimulate the meridians? We can allow these meridians to reconnect each other.

Network, how can we do that? How can we do the simple way without the use of mind, without the make mistake? All right, so if we can do that, we're ahead of the game. Right, and then we'll be able to continue and then we'll be able to see body changes. The body will change, but the body may be not change what you want, but they will change.

Think of this way, they might not change what you want, but they will change. You just have to open the mind, truly understand each organs, each elements, right? Because we are connected, everything is connected. So if we all connect this way, then we'll be able to deal the problems.

## Practical Exchange — Questions, Examples, and Closing

I give you a little bit of questions. Anyone have a questions before I real, go ahead. I'm just curious, getting back to the gallbladder being removed, there are conditions where they have what's called phantom limb after an amputation.

People can have this sensation that they could feel their leg. Similarly, if you cut a plant or a leaf, you can actually use a, like it's a hologram. You can actually see the energetic footprint.

So I'm just wondering, it just seems, if I may say, kind of drastic to say that all people who have their gallbladder out can't make decisions. I mean, might the energetic meridians still be in place, but the organ be removed? It just seems so, if I may say, black and white, if that it's never kind of person who has a gallbladder out make a decision. I'm just curious what you think about that.

Well, we go back to the same game. There are no accidents, right? If we based on that, there are no accidents. At the bigger picture, the person, the remove the gallbladder, they supposed to can function without a gallbladder because they are no accidents.

You have a meridians. Therefore, you can function without a gallbladder. From the modern science, the way we say space and the time, right? You only move the space, you haven't moved the time.

Time, more powerful than the space. You move the gallbladder, you only move out the space. You didn't move the time.

Time is the meridians. So therefore, you supposed to should be able function as the same way. Unfortunately, unfortunately, in order to function without a gallbladder, your body has to function different kind of energetic harmony, which is you haven't made.

So therefore, has a symptoms. You got it? Because you didn't make a requirement function at the without a gallbladder function. Each level has a different requirement.

With a gallbladder, without a gallbladder, it's a different kind of function. You understand? It's a different kind of function. So without a gallbladder, which means that you wonder, now you eat, tonight you're going to eat the pizza with extra cheese.

Now, Ling also has egg salads and has a lot of the black bean soup. Now look at this, all of these things require gallbladder pass a lot of bio, right? But you don't have a gallbladder. So what's happening? Suppose if your liver function at the highest level.

So liver and the gallbladder is the twin brother sisters. And therefore, liver should be able processing and create a different kind of manifest, different kind of chemical change and the path of some kind of energetic way to support a stomach, be able to digest all of these food without the problems. Unfortunately, you're under a lot of stress.

You are middle of the divorce. Your mind is crazy. Your liver never functions, right? Then how can your body meet this kind of requirement? Therefore, you cannot eat that kind of food.

See, everything is energy, but every energy has a requirement. You have to meet the requirement. You don't meet the requirement, it doesn't go that way.

See, we say body can heal itself. Body can heal itself, it's based on if you meet the requirement of the balance and harmony. If you don't meet the requirement of the balance and harmony, it doesn't heal itself, right? So we have to understand called the requirement, right? If your SAT is so low, how can you get in the Harvard unless you pay different money? There's different ways.

If we're based on the SAT, you have to meet that number. You don't meet the number, you don't go to that. You don't go to the Ivy League, you just go to community college, right? That's it is if we're based on the SAT, unless we change.

See, rule has to be rule. Law has to be law. Just a different level require a different kind of rule, different kind of law.

One more thing, if I may. It's also a compensatory thing. So like for example, you're saying that if the gallbladder's out, then you have to stress other, like the liver to compensate, to make decisions or whatever function.

Like a heart that's blocked may make a compensatory circulation to function. Now people can function like that. Maybe it doesn't meet the exact requirement, but it's possible for people.

If everything's unlimited and all things are possible, so can't compensatory things work? Everything is possible as long as you meet the requirement. I say that again. So all we see, we see is a visible level.

We never see invisible level. Just like all we talk about the consciousness, we still talk about the consciousness at the mind, right? How many times you will hear the people talk about consciousness of the tree? Consciousness of the nature. Think of this.

If I say liver, liver consciousness, you only think about the, oh, your anger feelings, the maximum you only stuck in your mind. Talk about your emotions. How can you say my liver connected to the tree? Consciousness, fairness, flexible, grow.

You wouldn't think my liver can do this. Then you would never think about my liver will connect to the spring consciousness. When the spring come, just like a voice to all the earth, all the planes, every life is, come on, it's time to grow.

So what does that mean? That means when the spring come, my liver should be exciting. Hey, get a party tonight. But no, at the spring come, I'm depressed.

So how can that be? Suppose my liver should connect to that kind of consciousness. Why not? That's when we talk about the energy, when we talk about consciousness, which level you try to connect. Even we call consciousness, which level of the consciousness you try to connect.

Even I say that that way, I still hasn't jumped out of our galaxy. Think about it. All we talk about it, I still talk about it in our galaxy.

Even though I talk about it in our galaxy, already difficult. Can you imagine you talk about it? How can my liver connect to the Mars? How can my liver connect? My Mars is still in this, our solar system. Can we alter our solar system? Can we? Definitely possible.

It's a quantum. Right? What element is a quantum? The quantum information. There's no time, no space.

But even though you can understand in that level, I can understand that level, but still doesn't mean I function at that level. I'm sorry, I have to say that myself. If I function at that level, I can make a tree grow in my hand.

But however, I only understand in my mind, I haven't make my liver function at that level yet. If that level can function, forget it. Spring, you can walk on, you just walk on the dead grass, everything will be green.

I'm telling you, that just that kind of power, because you are the vehicle, carried all the consciousness for the spring. It's because everything is connected. But in order to get at that level, you have to meet the requirement.

See, that's the difficult part, right? That's what we try to do here. How can we allow the body meet the requirement? How do we relate Qigong, the practice of Qigong, Tai Chi, to what you're discussing in terms of the meridians or capacity or health? I mean, I have, in my mind, it feels connected. But I'd like to hear from you, the relationship of that practice to what we're talking about today.

You practice any kind of energetic movement, energetic system, the purpose is which level you want to interfere, or which level you want to connect. There are many different things that people say, oh, I do this for energy exercise, right? It is an energy exercise. Energy exercise, the highest level is connected to the meridians.

Can you connect to the meridians? Can you allow meridians change, which is not easy? That means you have to meet the requirement, allow the meridians function change. It's a function. They download a certain, you say, hey, now I want to do something more.

Can you do that? They supposed to allow this to you, but you have to meet the requirement. You don't meet the requirement, then never impact to the meridians. You only impact to your mind.

It's a different kind of Qi, different kind of energy. You talk about the Qigong, talk about the energy exercise, they all talk about what is the outcome. See, outcome, which level you are, right? So the highest level is without the mind.

So as long as you use the mind, you're always at the low level, put it this way. Doesn't matter what you do, no matter what kind of exercise or what kind of energy do, as long as you're touching the mind, you're always at the low level because the mind always yesterday. Mind never is the future, right? But if I can use the mind, everyone can do that because it's not mine, see, it's a body.

It's a meridians, it's without the mind. So you have to deal something without the mind. Now you have to meet the requirement of the energy law.

Energy has an energy law, meridians has a meridians law. Each one has their own law. You have to meet the requirement, something can happens.

I give you one thing, so people always, people say, oh, I do the energy exercise. The body never lie. If you do energy exercise, if your energy meet the requirements, something will happen.

Why thinking this way? Why something will happen? We say that you have a two thing, you have an energy body and a physical body, right? Physical body, most likely only controlled by your mind. Energy body cannot be controlled by the mind. You cannot control your energy.

Your mind cannot control the meridians, right? Energy body only can control by the outer space. So the outer space, the universal mind or universal consciousness, life, they are dying to waiting for the opportunity. You can have life, they can use your body to show they are exist.

Understand that concept? They are looking for this opportunity. They are begging you, please wake up. Every day, every moment, they are begging, please allow me through you, can dance and can show.

So if you meet the requirement, they immediately jump in to show. Life is for show, right? You are happy, you immediately show on your face. Energy is the same thing, they will show.

They will show the result. If you meet a requirement, illness, disease will change. Automatically, they have to show.

If it doesn't change, it didn't meet the requirement. Very simple, right? Master Lu, so if I understand correctly, like illness and symptoms are an attempt to upgrade the software in some way. Going through an illness and a symptom is like an attempt to upgrade a software.

So when you go through it, you reach your spiritual purpose. No, that's not what I say. You go through the sentence, depending on the sentence, how do you go through the sentence? If you suppress, that doesn't mean you go through it, you just detour.

Yes. That right? You just detour. So therefore, your spirit still doesn't come out.

They come out a different way. Okay, but the illness and the symptom are the attempt from the spirit to wake you up. We have a chance.

See? We, which is today, most people learn through the illness, that's the only way to achieve highest health. Good life, right? See? You have illness. If you cure yourself, you have a good life.

If you don't cure yourself, you just suffer. Right? So we all learn this way through the illness, I might have a good life, right? Make sense? That's what we do. That's what we all learn this.

But unfortunately, we're all stuck in that way. We don't cure. So purpose is you wanna have, we all wanna have good life, good health, but not we all understand through this processing, we can get a good health.

Right? The purpose illness disease is try to get a good life. Right? You get a good life. You go through the illness.

Now today, you learn, oh, that's another way to get a good life without the suffer. I try to teach you. That's the new way.

You try to pass this to your patients. Hey, you don't have to suffer. You still can get what you want.

Through the positive way, through the enhanced each organ's function, you still can get a good health and without a suffer. See, I'm telling you, right? That's we are difficulty because we're still facing to the illness disease. Think of this way.

Illness and the disease are like a mosquito. Mosquito. If you have a lot of mosquito in your backyard, there's a two kind of way.

One is to find out how to kill the mosquito. You go to Home Depot, Lowe's, you know, garden center, buy all the products and try to kill the mosquito, right? The other way is to change your environment, right? Mosquito, the new generation of the mosquito need water. If you don't give it the water, how can new generation mosquito come? See, I'm teaching you, don't go to Home Depot, buy the new product, just allow the water disappear.

You change the environment. You know water, know mosquito. Insert the new product, kill the mosquito.

It's totally different ways, right? You just have to think different way. So that's why the beauty of the Chinese medicine is think different, right? So through this kind of Xiao Dao concept, can you change your thinking? Can you change the way how to recognize illness disease? How do we see the life? How do you see yourself? And you can do that, it's worth it. This whole program is worth it because you change.

Take how many years to make yourself change. If this is small, two days, you change, thank God. I got a lot of credit, I can sleep.

I really wish you guys can change. You know, that would be a miracle. Master Liu, regarding health and disease, what is the role of our ancestors in passing on our health or our disease? What's that mean? Can group consciousness of our ancestors, our bloodline pass along DNA that reflects both health and or disease? What is that means? Give me the English.

You still give me the medical terms, you didn't give me the English. Can you get affected health-wise by what's happened from your ancestors? Can they have either adverse or positive effects on your health? I mean, you talk about, you've told us. Okay, so let me ask you this.

What do you concern that is your ancestors? How far you can go back? How far? How far can I go back? That's right, how far you wanna go back? See? I don't know. That's right, so how do you know all of these illness and the disease hasn't happened for 2,000 years ago? If based on the today, we understand time and space, all the past and the future and this present, it all happens at the same time. Then how do we know the disease, what you talk about, is it not 10,000 years later? You don't know.

So therefore, when you use this kind of vocabulary called the genetic, it's your own misunderstanding of the genetic concept, right? So why you have to discriminate that yourself as a genetic only receive the disease, you don't receive the gift? Then why on a mound, all the possibility you sit in that the worms, you have a choice to pick up the DNAs, you pick up the disease, you think it's accidents? They are no accidents, right? If they are no accidents, then therefore it's not a disease and illness, it's not a genetic disease, it's a genetic gift waiting for you, used for what purpose? It's all up to us, how do we see the situation? I want everyone in real thinking this concept, think of this, you come here, you draw, right? If you fly, anyone fly here, you fly here, you go through the security check, right? You cannot carry the knife, right? Why you cannot carry the knife? Think of this, why? It's a weapon, right? Many concerned it's a weapon. So each one of us at the kitchen, we have a lot of weapons. In your kitchen, you have a weapon.

Then why I'm allowed my kids go to your house to have parties? You have a weapon in the kitchen. Now how do you know the middle of the cooking, you are unhappy and something burn up, the knife won't turn into the weapons, right? But no one will think in this way, right? How simple is it? Why? It's a weapon, see? It's all up to us, how to see things. If you are focused on the illness and disease, you were looking for this kind of thing, right? If you're looking for the positive way, you always looking for the positive way.

You know, I give you one very simple, it's how do you see, it's a perception. It's all about the perception. Very famous, you know, what's called a condition is one of my patient.

He always complain his mother. Every time become unhappy because the mother love his brother, doesn't love him. Everything is complain, complain, complain.

Again, again, again. One day I say, you shut up. You see, he said, how can you shut up? You don't give me the good things to, you know, confidence allow me think, you know, what I think is wrong.

I say, you don't appreciate your mother. I say, no, you know, she's bad. I said, I have the one thing for you to do, just do it, please, just do one week.

If one week later you still complain your mother's, you're a winner. I give up, I won't say anything. He said, okay, I will do it.

So I'll do anything because I've been being the therapist for, you know, whole life. I still cannot get over it. I say, I guarantee one week you get over it.

So what I want to handle, I want to get the vegetable, put it in the back, carry on here, day and the night. And sleep on it, day and the night, a week. He only do one day, cannot handle it.

I say, see, only one day, this one only two pounds. Your mother carry you for eight pounds for nine months. You better shut up.

You still complain? One day you cannot handle that. Without the love, how can she carry you for that long? You think your mother doesn't love you? After that, he doesn't say anything. He will call to her and say, mother, I'm sorry.

I say, go, say your mother, you are sorry. You shouldn't do that. See, one day cure how many years, the problem.

You only need the right things that can be immediately wake up to understand just how to do them, do the right, immediately you can change. All right, I think you guys have got enough, got a lot. I hope you can digest it for tonight.

All right, digest, go through it. You know, please, there's two things, right? Here we have a code, I later on, I give you some concept to build up, right? One is energetic to build up, which is the Marines, to allow you see. The other is the natural law, right? You should use your own language to see.

Does you understand? If not understand tomorrow, we need a little bit of time to make this one understanding. And then we can continue. You know, my goal, I have a goal.

My goal is a real wish, you know, these two days, you can get it. I will try that kind of way to make sure you can get it. And then you can, you'll be able to use.

You have to get it from your own way, own language, right? Not my way. You should say that your way. See, you can manipulate a different way.

See, you can talk to yourself. You see, you have to convince yourself what you do is right. Don't convince me.

If you cannot convince yourself, how can you convince your patient? Don't do that, right? At least to convince yourself what you do is right. Right? That's it. Thank you very much.

See you tomorrow.
