Chapter 1 — Opening: Listening and Trying

I don't know how to explain what I'm experiencing right now except that what I'm experiencing is kind of like a half-awake, half-asleep state.

It feels like sometimes a person can get stuck in a loop where they keep trying things and nothing changes.

I have people tell me 'I tried this, I tried that, I tried the supplements, I tried the herbs, I tried the diet, I tried the exercise' and their story is essentially the same. They keep trying random things and nothing changes.

What I have observed is that there are some underlying things that are not being addressed.


Chapter 2 — Picking the Liver and Stomach

One of the key observations is that people often pick parts of the body like the liver or the stomach to work on without understanding the centrality of these organs.

When we say "pick liver" or "pick stomach" it's not just the physical organ we mean, it includes the meridian, it includes the whole system that engages with other organs.

The liver particularly is not just about detoxification. The liver is about flow, smoothness, decision-making in the body, and even emotions.

The stomach and spleen system is more about processing, digesting, absorbing, and coordinating with the rest of the body.


Chapter 3 — The Power of the Liver

The liver can be a primary driver in why people feel stuck. If the liver is constricted, everything downstream becomes stuck: digestion, moods, energy, the ability to make decisions. The liver has a lot to do with making choices and moving Qi.

This is why we sometimes focus heavily on the liver when somebody has chronic issues — because if the liver can't move, it disrupts the whole house.

In women, the liver plays a particularly clear role: menstrual health, hormonal rhythms, and emotional regulation are all tightly tied to the liver's ability to circulate blood and Qi.


Chapter 4 — Training, Flexibility, and the Practitioner

For a practitioner, it's essential to be flexible and to keep refining the approach. What worked for one person may not work for another, and the same person can respond differently over time.

We need to be trained in observing patterns, in listening to the body's feedback, and in adapting our intervention.

The job is to be the optimizer: to find what breaks the stuck pattern and to help the person move through it.


Chapter 5 — Digestive Earth: Stomach & Spleen

When we look at the digestive system we are thinking about the Earth element: the stomach and spleen. They are responsible for transformation and transportation.

Poor digestion affects everything — nutrient absorption, immunity, mood. Children often show digestive imbalances differently than adults.

We must look at digestive tone, regularity, the color and smell of the stool, appetite, and how the person experiences food.


Chapter 6 — Meridians, Transplant, and the Body’s Wiring

Meridians are not merely superficial lines. They are an actual system that carries information and function.

Sometimes people confuse the hardware (the organ) with the software (the meridian network and the energetic programming).

Even with transplant scenarios, where an organ is replaced, the meridian network and the rest of the body still need to be aligned. Hardware can be replaced; the software needs to be updated.


Chapter 7 — The Network and the Versions of the Universe

Think of the body as a network, and the meridians as the data channels.

There are many versions of the universe — meaning different scales and contexts in which energy shows up and works. We must be aware of which layer we are working on.

Different modalities speak different languages about the same hardware and software; we need to translate and pick the right tool for the layer present.


Chapter 8 — Questions About the Gallbladder and Removal

People ask what happens when the gallbladder is removed. The liver continues to produce bile and will still drain, but the mechanisms change.

With the gallbladder removed, digestion can be less organized. You have to pay attention to bile flow, fat digestion, and timing of meals.

Practically, if a patient has had the gallbladder removed, we watch for bile stagnation and treat the liver to encourage a smoother flow.


Chapter 9 — Energy Practice and Qigong

Qigong and energy work help train the body and mind to feel and to move Qi more smoothly.

The physical practices build awareness, but the meridian work helps the body update its software to allow those new patterns to become stable.

The law of energy is not mystical: it is reproducible when we apply consistent practice and correct alignment.


Chapter 10 — Illness as Teacher, the Mosquito Analogy

Illness often tells us where our system is weak or stuck. Like a mosquito finding exposed skin, disease exploits where the system has an opening.

We can reframe illness as information — guidance for where to apply repair and training.

The mosquito analogy is helpful: if we patch the skin where mosquitoes bite, we prevent future bites. If we train the system, the same principle applies.


Chapter 11 — Ancestors, Perception, and Final Notes

There is also the role of heritage and history in the system: our ancestors' patterns can influence how our meridians and responses develop.

Perception is powerful. What we believe about our body changes how the body shows up. Convincing yourself of a new pattern is part of the work.

Two key things matter: the meridians and the natural laws that govern how energy moves. If we align both, the body has the capacity to reorganize.

End of book-style rewrite.
