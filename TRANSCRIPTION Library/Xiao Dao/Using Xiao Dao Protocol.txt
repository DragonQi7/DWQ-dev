So we talk about the stomach. Now we're going to go to the second one, which is the wood element, right? It's my favorite. That's always my favorite.

I love it, because the more I study, the more I doing this, more I love it. Because that is the one kind of spirit can show all the spirits. That's one kind of spirit can carry for the real spirit.

Everything can go through this level. And particularly, it's very useful for healings, for activities, for your activity, what's called the talents. You have all talents.

Everyone have talents. How do you show? Right? Just like how do you show your spirit? You show your spirit through your eyes, because the eye is the window of the liver, right? So every organ, they have to find a way to reach out. Think of it this way, right? That's the organ.

That's the baby. That's your kids hiding inside. How do they see outside? How do they see outside the world? How does your liver see outside the world? They have to see.

One, they see through the meridians, through the point. They see through the energetic frequency, which is the most time you don't know. But you do know.

You only know effect. What's that mean? When you suddenly get angry, then your friend say, what's going on with you? But you don't understand. What you see, you receive information through the meridians.

It doesn't through your eyes, right? It's the meridians impact you. You suddenly get angry, get a frustration. Your husband say, what's wrong? It's not what's wrong with you.

Your husband will be smart and say, what's wrong with me, right? That's a different class, how to teach your husband be nice way. Honey, what's wrong with me? I will make you cry. No, it's the other way.

But anyway, right? We see. But the other way is organs through the eyes see outside of this reality. You through the eyes see, right? But here has one issue.

One, what we always say, because of vocabulary, when I say see and look, most time we look, we don't see. I can look. It's the lungs responsibility.

Listen to me here. Lungs function good or bad. When you make your eye can look or not look.

Your sense can open. How to open is based on the lung function. Lungs make a decision.

You have a good lung, every part of your body can do. You can look. Once you look, can you see? See is a wisdom.

See is a wisdom. Which level you are, you see which level of things, right? It's another way everyone see same thing. Otherwise, we all see same thing, same stuff.

No. Each one of us see things differently. Because what? Because we have a different wisdom.

Because we have a different spirit. Right? Because our liver function at a different way, we'd be able to see things differently. Because the liver can do this way, then the liver has to meet the liver requirement.

Right? It's the wood requirement. Wood has wood consciousness. Wood has wood essence.

Right? So that's why I use that one as the wood. Gigantic wood. Now you can see this one and the big wood trees.

And the small one at here, they still grow. They are not depressed. So they say, oh, my lord, would take me how many years have your same height? Have you see that? The small one never complain.

Oh, forget it. I will never reach the same height. And the small one, look at the human beings.

They're going to step on me. They're going to break on me. I'm another grow.

I'm depressed. Why? It's no fair. I grow so slow.

Why you? Not me. Right? Yeah. You heard it that way.

It doesn't look like it. It's a human being. It's not tree.

Tree never do that. That's how you know. It's funny.

Right? Tree never say that way. Why? Each one of the trees, when they grow, they receive the promise of the nature. Mother Earth, the promise.

Nature's promise. Life will be promised. See, grow is based on the promise.

It's based on the future. Life will be promised. So if we can receive this consciousness of the liver grow, then we receive the promise.

Promise of the life will be beautiful. Then also, their root is all under there. The root never complain.

Have you seen the root saying, that's unfair. I suck out all the, I do all this work, nutrients, processing. No one pay attention.

They all pay attention after leave for flowers. The root get depressed. I'm not growing anymore.

See tomorrow, next year you have beautiful flowers. Have you seen the root doing this? Root never do that. Right? We always enjoy the flower.

We never say, wow, I appreciate the root. That's called balance. In and young.

Invisible, invisible. The visible successful has to be based on the invisible. That's always cooperate.

Always balance together. Because the liver has to be grow this way. That's the essence.

So what is the two things? Two of the very important things to make this function in human body can help the liver function reach the highest level. A basic requirement allow our liver can function properly. The two things, right? One, stagnation.

One is flexibility. Liver has to be related to everything grow. Flow.

Wing flow. You see the wing come. So that's why wing are associated with the liver.

Right? How do we know has wing? Wing you cannot see. But we only can see effect of the wing. The tree or the plane waiting to allow the wing come.

See? Allow through me. The tree will say through me. Even I might die for you.

But I'm waiting to allow you go through me. So the wing always associate with the liver. Right? Through me.

Flow through me. From invisible become visible. Wing is invisible.

Right? We show effect of the wing. So that's why we see the visible. When you see the tree moves, we know it's windy.

Or we can hear the sound. But sound we cannot most time unless the sound plays. You do hear the sound of the wing.

So the flow is very important. If it doesn't flow, then we call it what? Stagnation. Stuck.

Tied up. Stagnation. We say stagnation has two things.

I say that before. Visible, invisible. Visible which is all the stuff.

Stuff. Right? Can cause the blood stagnation. Food stagnation.

Right? The colon stagnation you constipated. Right? Right? Stagnation. Stuck there.

Doesn't move. Doesn't move slowly. Right? Fat stagnation.

That's stagnation too. Some people accumulate a lot of fat. Some people accumulate a lot of muscle.

Then they take supplement to allow big muscle. You see that? Also stagnation. You see the big muscle.

Also stagnation. Look good. Useless.

Yeah. It look good. You see the big body got big muscle.

Then you think so scary. No. If something they even have no time to pull the gun.

It's too slow. Right? They cannot become flexible. Think of this.

Big muscle. They all think muscle. Muscle is become stomach.

Right? We say muscle associated with the stomach. Tendon associated with the liver. You want to be flexible.

Then you want the tendon be flexible. So that's why stretch is the best exercise. So we always say be the cat.

Don't be the cow. Have you seen the cat doing exercise? Go to the treadmill. Get in the trial.

We left. The cat sleep. Stretch.

Right? Cows constantly move big muscle there. Cat sleep. Flexible.

So need the cat muscle. You don't want to have a cow muscle. Right? Be the cat.

Cat always sleep. Why still flexible? Cow constantly move still. Broken knee.

Angles. Why be flexible? It's very important. If you are not flexible, you are stuck.

Right? When you stuck, you have the blood stagnation. The blood stagnation can continue cause the tumors, other issues. They have a cheese stagnation.

Cheese stagnation also can accumulate and become blood stagnation. Now has the other kind of stagnation. Think of this way.

It's emotional stagnation. So if emotional stagnation was happening, we will penetrate to different organs. Depending where happening.

Depending where you want to go. We all have experience. If you over worry, if you worry too much, what's happening? You lose appetite.

Right? You lose appetite. You don't feel hungry. How come? See? How come? You don't eat.

You worry. Emotions. Emotions accumulate.

Accumulation, accumulate. You accumulate the stuff. Cause the visible stomach.

Grow up. Right? So people say, I eat from my eyes. I'm not from my stomach.

You eat from your minds. Not from your stomach. The emotional accumulation also can cause the stagnation.

The stagnation is one of the today, many modern disease, which a lot called autoimmune disease, as of today are associated with stagnation. As of today, so many illness. There's one kind of illness called dryness.

Everything is dry. Dry mouth, dry nose. That's the particular kind called stagnation.

Inside doesn't move. Accumulate the heat. Think about it.

Where the dry come from? How can you accumulate the heat? Does anyone doing compost? If you have experience for the compost, you will understand. Compost put it there, doesn't move. Why have a heat? Because it doesn't move.

Why compost? Accumulate the heat. Garbage bag you tied up has a heat. So if a body you tied up doesn't move, accumulate the heat also.

So that kind of heat will burn all your body through. So that's why you're dry. Your eye become dry.

That means liver stuck. Your mouth become dry. That means your stomach is dry.

Your nose become dry. That means your lungs start to dry. Your skin is dry.

Your lungs get dry. See, you can name whatever your body part, you can associate your organs. Because something doesn't move, stuck.

So we have to find a way to move. How to find a way to move? Your mind. Your belief.

Your thinking. Most of the time, our life is based on what we believe. You believe he's good, everything's good.

You believe it's bad, everything's bad. We see what we want to see. So you change your belief.

You change the way how to receive the reality. Then you change your feelings. You change the flow.

So the answer for the stagnation is make sure they can flow. To flow, energetic flow. Qi flow.

Emotional flow. It's very, very important. If it doesn't flow, it will accumulate the heat.

Accumulate the stagnation. Second one is to be flexible. Flexibility.

Flexible. So that's why I say like a cat, not like a cow. You want to have a good tendon, not a good muscle.

In the Chinese martial arts, we always say you rather have one inch tendon. You don't want the one foot muscle. Muscle is useless.

Tendon is more important. All the speed, all the flexibility, all the skill later is all based on the tendons. Never based on the muscle.

Anyone play golf? Play tennis? Then you understand. They're all based on the tendons. They're never based on the muscle.

Don't think a big muscle can throw the ball further. Doesn't do any, has nothing to do with your muscle. It's do with cooperation, all the tendons.

It's a tendon. Now you understand. Tendon is so important.

Also with the quality of your tendon is a quality of your liver function. Let me put it this way. There's something you can do.

From outside, stimulate the inside. It's stimulated through your tendon. Stretch your tendon.

Be flexible. You see this today. When age is getting older, what's happening? Stiffness, not flexible.

One of the aging things is not flexible. Spine becomes stiffness. Joint becomes stiffness.

Back becomes stiffness. Nothing can move. Even now we understand that way.

So we start moving this. What do we do? You are not moving joints. You're moving your ages.

See? You're purveying your ages. That's called longevity. That's called the quality of the life.

You want to be flexible. You want to be independent. You don't want someone to hold you.

Do something. And which is possible. You don't need a specific.

You don't need expensive machines. All you need is just to sit there and watch TV. You still can stretch.

How simple is it? You still can stretch. It's a simple thing. Stretch.

So these two of the most important things, the essence of the liver, will help you to understand. And then the third one is cold also. The liver doesn't like cold.

The liver doesn't like cold. The liver doesn't like heat. Don't put the heat to the liver.

You put the heat into the liver, you get a stroke. The liver is called the pain in the neck. It's a little bit, you know, it's almost like ashes drop on the cheesecake.

Have you understand? When the ashes drop on the cheesecake, you cannot blow up, you cannot die. It's just stuck there. Right? Because the ashes drop on the cheesecake.

What are you going to do? It's difficult. Right? Think of this. Now you understand.

Wow, cheesecake ashes on the top. What am I going to do? I cannot blow up. Right? Right.

That's the liver. Too hot, liver doesn't function. Too cold, liver does not function.

So how do we know you have a liver hot, liver cold? Now we go to the various theories. Now everyone should check yourself. What do I have for my liver issue? Right? We start from top down or bottom up? Bottom up.

Okay. Bottom up. We do the bottom up.

Bunions first. Right? If you find you have a bunion problem. Right? Your big toes, always the bones start grow up.

That's the signs of your liver issues. Right? Spring angles. Right? Angles.

You say, oh, every time when I was a kid, I did it two times. I prayed the days. Yeah, angles.

Angles also is represented as the liver issue. Right? Angles. PMS.

Menstrual cramp. Any kind. All the female issues.

Liver issue. It's a blood issue. It's a liver issue.

Right? Ulcer. It's a liver issue. Ulcer.

Liver issue. Nail. You don't grow the nail.

Your nail has a lot of lines. Your nail easy broke. Your nail never grow fast enough.

That's a liver issue. Hair. Always dry.

No matter what kind of shampoo you pay expensive for shampoos. It's a liver issue. Take care of your liver.

You have beautiful hair. Don't waste your money. Right? That's a liver issue.

Eye. Liver issue. Joint.

Liver issues. Any kind of sport injury. Liver issues.

Liver has a lot of issues. I'm telling you, it's a modern disease. You can't say high cholesterol is liver issues.

Right? Stroke is liver issues. Breast cancer is liver issues. Right? There's so many liver issues as of today.

You can name it. Arthritis is liver issues. I can name so many, you know, that kind of issue.

You know, more scary. It's become a modern disease. It's liver issues.

Now, even the one thing, you know, as of today, everybody have a cell phone. Right? So, how do you test the people? You do these things. Right? Move, move, move, move, move.

Your thumb continue to move. Sooner or later, you all have liver issues. Can cause your lung issue.

Can cause your colon issue. Can cause your liver issue. Even though here are associated with the lung, but will impact to your liver.

You over move it. Sooner or later, someone should figure out that the new specialty through the colon, through the lung, and through the liver because everyone has a cell phone as long as they do this. Too many.

And today, particularly today, cell phones, computers, we constantly on the screen of this called the EFM. Right? Electromagnetic frequency. Will impact to your eyes.

Impact to the body will cause the liver issues. Right? So, we know all of this is the liver issue. So, now what is the liver cold? Right? We say the cold and the heat.

Liver doesn't like it. So, we go to the cold first. Right? Cold.

Arthritis. Generally speaking. It's associated with the liver cold.

Menstrual cramp. Associated with the liver cold. I think what's called cystitis.

Associated with the liver cold. Chronic blood pains. Yeah.

That's the liver cold. It's not the liver heat caused. Then we go to the what is the liver heat.

Right? Once the liver become heat, that's a little bit of issue. Liver heat. Like as a reflex, usually the liver has a little bit of heat.

Chronic throat issues. Throat issues. Your throat constantly has some kind of chronic throat issues.

You know, depending on what kind of issue. Sometimes, usually it's liver heat. Liver has a heat.

Then what else? Then chronic bladder issues. For the female bladder discharge, you know, itchiness and the burning issue. They are all is the liver heat caused.

Which is called the liver heat. You know, Chinese call it the dam heat. But that kind of heat, when we call it, it's not heat.

It's something that doesn't move. Accumulated heat. You don't have a fire.

Accumulated that kind of. Stagnation caused the heat. Right? But the real fire also can cause the heat.

So that's why one, I shouldn't say, I still say that. So that's why today I know so many people because last time some, I think it's the one of the Olympic guys. And they do the cupping.

Right? Have you heard of the cupping? Everyone try to learn it. I say do not get on this business. You might put your health to the hell.

You will put to the hell. 90% I would say you put your health to the hell. Because you don't know.

Think of this way. You are normal body. So what do they do? They use a mechanical way.

Right? It's a mechanical way. So they, it's not, some people use heat. Use heat will be worse.

So you use the, just sucking things, sucking your blood out. So cause the blood stagnation. Right? After that, your whole back has all these bruised up lines.

That's called discrimination. Abuse. Can you imagine, you know? Yes.

Abuse you. But think of this. After your physical body be abused, which called the booze.

Right? Booze is how do we say that? Blood clot. Right? So think of this. It's a blood clot.

So blood clot at the body on the energy lines. So this clot has to be dissolved. Right? If it doesn't dissolve, you are going to sue that guy.

Right? Because cause the skin always have a black market. So because it can dissolve, what will it dissolve? They dissolve the clot. Blood clot.

So blood clot is what? It's unnatural way caused, the human caused clot. So therefore the dissolved this, they dissolve the what? Clot consciousness. Now this clot consciousness, where they going to go? Where they going to go? It goes to your liver, you get a liver tumor.

Goes to your stomach, you get a stomach tumor. Clot. Blood clot.

Where it goes? Consciousness. Right? Everything is energy. So be careful this kind of thing.

Unless you really understand, I use this one for specific healing, for purpose. Otherwise, certain kind of body cannot just do this thing. You will cause the later problems.

But you never make this connections. Often this kind of things we don't see. Right? We say that you don't see.

Doesn't mean it's not exist. Because the Eastern healing, they created this ancient time. They have a purpose.

That time they use the heat to deal with the cold issue. With a specific angle, specific marine has a certain kind of cold or certain kind of stagnation. They try use the heat to help resolve or dissolve this stagnation.

So that's why they use this kind of way. If you're not necessary and don't do that. So we know liver, we go back to that again, this liver.

In order liver can function better. Always say that the liver need function. Basic things is stagnation and the flexibility.

That's two of the basic things. But all of this stagnation and the flexibilities or flexibles all associated with the liver qi. Even though liver associated with the blood.

We move the blood. But the liver real move is the move the qi. So the liver qi here.

Follow me. This is tricky part here. If a liver is a real organ to show the qi is invisible way.

Then you should, we should real focus on invisible things. Right? Then therefore our emotions is qi. Our emotions if not the flow will impact to the liver worse.

Because it's invisible. Right? So you real want to get a liver, healthy liver. Watch our emotions.

And particularly watch our emotions at the natural, with the natural flow. What is that mean? Think of this. Spring.

Spring is the season for the liver. Right? When the liver come, everything has to flow. Right? Growth.

So the springtime liver flow, liver grow. So if at that time you suppressed, you cannot do what you want to do. You have a decision.

Someone tell you shut up. They cut your budget. Right? You get angry.

You have no place to expression yourself. Then your liver, qi be stagnant. Right? So if you have feelings, then you say I need to control my temper.

I want to be nice. Right? In the family dinner you want to be smile. Then you suppressed your feelings.

Long enough, you will cause the liver qi stagnation. You are not flexible. So be careful this kind of thing.

So the liver is associated with a lot of our daily life. Our daily life real impact to the liver function. Everywhere.

All the time. So when we, okay, here has one more thing. When I say it here, when I say liver, I hope everyone that's always included.

Godbrother. Right? Just like I say someone's family is include a husband and a wife. It's included.

Don't say I'm discrimination. I'm discriminate godbrother. All right? I wouldn't.

I didn't discriminate godbrother because it's already packed deal. It's inside. When I say liver, it's always include godbrother.

Right? Even godbrother is small. I think yesterday we say that godbrother is a small organ but it is big meridians. Nature never make a mistake.

There's always a balance. Godbrother is even though so tiny but the meridians are so big. So powerful.

Can control godbrother is only one meridians to control all the meridians. Has that kind of capability. One tiny godbrother connect to the everything.

All right? So godbrother is very, very, very important organ. Okay. So we done the two of the major organs.

Right? So that's two weapons what we need. We need to focus on the stomach. We need to focus on the liver.

So we know these two organs system are involved for how many different kind of illness disease. You name. Almost.

No matter what you name, I always can tell you they are associated. Now you can see why this is shout out cancer. It's very useful for this kind of cancer.

For today, it's a complicated information, complicated illness and disease. We don't know how do we start. Go to the natural law.

Bring each organ back to their normal balance. Once each organ came back their normal function, body can heal itself. Because what? Because the meridians.

It's not just organ itself. The meridians are connected to the nature. Connected to the universe.

Right? You just become the mirror. See? If you clean the mirror, everything can reflection. Right? If a mirror doesn't clean all the dust, you see nothing.

So you want to see the spirit. You want to see outside the universe. You have to clean the mirror.

So your body is the three-dimensional mirror you have to clean. So this concept, you are not just use this concept for your patients, but also can good for yourself. So you should try this one for yourself.

See what your digestive system, how good it is. What things you can digest? What things you cannot digest? What things limit you? What things is not limit you? What things you can let go? What things you still hold down, you cannot let go? You should apply this. Because what we say, light connect to the light.

The highest level does always go to the what? Invisible level. That we say that. There's always invisible.

What is invisible? Your meridians impact to your patients' meridians. You have to understand. That's the highest level.

Invisible. See? Same acupoint. Why some master, they put it as a result.

You put it as no result. Because their meridians is a flow. Your meridians stuck.

So therefore, you only have a physical effect. So talk about these things I didn't say yesterday. Because acupoints, some point, doesn't matter who you are.

Just put it there, they always have a result. It doesn't matter because that's just a point. You know, good, you put it.

Some point is not. Some point, you don't have a skill. You put it, you don't have a result.

And some point, you don't have a skill. You put it there. It's not you don't have a result.

You create the illness, create the disease. So just be careful. It's not just very simple.

Anyone say, oh yeah, I can put a needle there. No. Every point has a purpose.

Every point is the gateway to connect to the universe. How to through this gate is different, right? Do you have a special path that can through this one quickly? You don't. You go to the slow.

Slow, right? The path is very important. Your self-cultivation is very important. Right? So you have to use this concept to allow yourself to go through this Shaodao concept.

Can you? You should apply this concept to allow yourself to grow. Can you grow? You can grow. You will be able to connect to the whole universe.

You can digest everything. Your stomach. You digest the system change.

You connect, you can connect to your fearness. You connect to the spirit. Everything can go through you.

Can you? Would you? You should ask this kind of question. Right? So we always say to heal others, heal yourself first. Your self has to be truly understand.

Oh, that concept. I got a benefit first. Then you do this.

Then you apply this. You have more passion. Right? It's a passion.

Passion first. Skill is the second. All right? Passion first.

What is the passion? You love yourself. Think of this what I say. You love yourself.

What is yourself? Who are you? See? Go back to the same question. Right? Who are you? You say, which part of me? Right? My part of me is my stomach. What kind of part of my stomach? My stomach can be Grand Canyon.

My stomach can be just my backyard dirt. Right? Where is the liver? Your liver can be the redwood trees. You know, all connect together.

You go east. Everywhere is yours. Depend.

How do you want to connect? Right? Your trees. Your livers. I always wonder one of the trees at England.

So as one at the front of the church has one tree. It's called a yew tree. That tree has 4,000 years old.

4,000 years old. Older than the Buddha. Older than the Jesus.

They still survive. You go there. You connect it to the whole different lives.

That tree bring back to so many go that tear just dropped. Because so much of the love. So much of the connections with the nature.

You see these things. You see these natures. And they bring a lot of this joy.

A lot of this wisdom. A lot of spirits allow you say, hey, I better do something. So we've done it this way.

So then go to the second question. I cannot just base on that one. Right? So we know the rule.

Stomach rule. We know the rule of the liver rule. How do we do that? How are we going to start that? Now we go to the second level.

How do we start? How do we clean out our stagnation? How about that? Now we do the self-cleaning. Self-cleaning. We say that at the beginning.

Life is based on the Marines. Marines is a network to help you connect to the internal body, external body. Visible world and invisible world.

In the Marines also has a key point. The point. In the Marines.

So every point will lead you to the different, the universe. Lead you different gates. Allow you connect to the universe.

So by doing this, we'll be able to heal ourself. Also we'll be able to connect to the more information. We can heal ourself more balance quickly.

And then also we can help others. Right? So we can give this one to the patients. They can do that.

They'll be more sensitive. Right? If their Marines are sensitive, their body can heal themselves quickly. So among the body, among all the different points, millions of different points.

So I ask my masters many years ago. How many years? I forget. How many years ago? I say, can you figure out the four points? I say, the Americans don't have patience.

They don't want to. Somehow the mind want more. But I say, we don't have time.

Can you figure out the four points? We'll cover almost everything. And he helped me to figure out these four points. So we have these four points, which we call the four energy gates.

So if we massage, if yourself stimulate this point, we might send a signal to the body. Say, hey, it's time to reorganize. Make a harmony.

So we go to the number one. Okay, number one is here. That's right.

Number one. We all have this one. Right? In acupuncture, they call the large intestine four.

I can say it this way. If you know this one, you can fix 50% of the problems. It's the most, the most, as of today, for what I learned, it's the most unique point in the human body.

The most unique. And it can associate almost 50% of the illness and the disease. But just depending on your level.

Your level. So what is this point can do? This point located at the, between thumb and index. So the thumb associated with the lumbar region, and the index finger associated with the large intestines.

So this point is at the, between here. So because here doesn't see the, you know, perfect way. You can see yourself.

Everyone can see yourself. And just see. Between these called the valleys and the inside, you will see the color different.

Right? The different color. Everyone is, the color different. Shape different.

Right? So just between the color difference, you should go one, almost one millimeter. Back to the different colors. You will see the color.

You will see the color lines. You all can see the color lines. Right? It's the two colors.

Different. If it has one color, you should call 911. That's right.

Good. You are two colors. Good.

We don't need to call 911. Right? That's right. We are two colors.

That's right. You see the, once you see the two colors, and then you go to the, you know, almost at the here. That's two colors, I suppose.

Right? That's just one centimeter back to the two colors. That's the spot. That's the first energy gate.

You should try to massage yourself. This gate, what it can do? Through this gate will allow you connect to the lung function. The lung function, by doing this, you can connect.

Through this gate, you will be connected to the heart function because lung and heart has a relationship. Through this gate can connect to all your eye issues, your brain issues. Through this gate will help your colon issues, so which is your eliminations.

Right? We say the one of the digestive system, shout out, can you let it go? If you're stuck, doesn't go. So this one, you will let it go. You can let it go.

You can receive. Right? So therefore, the colon. But colon getting better.

Your brain getting better. You have to understand your brain function. You don't want to get Alzheimer's.

Right? The brain associated colon. So this point will make you smart, intelligent. All your beautiful skin.

Oh, lady, you will love me. Your wrinkles. That is the major spot.

You really know this. You don't have to buy expensive cream. I know you don't believe it.

You still buy expensive one. But that is more expensive. It's priceless.

Right? And also, you should understand, this point can deal anything, I would say, above your shoulder. On the top, anything. Ear, whatever something above your shoulder.

This point can handle it. And the most likely interesting thing. Think of this way.

If there are no accidents. If there are no accidents, then that's the only two of the body parts. Body part is the lower body, which is the colon at here.

Right? But the meridians are here. How can that happen? How can meridians on your fingers, but the body part is on your lower stomach? Doesn't connect. Right? But they connect from different dimensions.

It's different dimensions, space and time connections. So any kind of your soul issues, this can take care of. So which means what I say, above the diseases, so any kind of infection, right? Sinus.

Sinus infections. Eye issues, right? This all can take care. So that's why that, because this one soul you need, that are number one in our four energy gates.

So they are the first ones show up. All right? So if you say you are too busy, I know, everybody is busy. I don't have time.

What I should do? Just tell me one thing. I say this point. That's it.

When someone is so busy, they do one point. Okay? That's number one. Now we go to the number two.

Who's number two? That's number two. No, I don't need to see this one. Number two.

Number two. It's right on the center. I know a lot of people go to the acupuncturist, they put a needle over here.

Right? If any acupuncturist understand. Do not let anyone put a needle here. Please.

For your safety. That is what I just said. It's the one point require many, many, many years of training.

And some master still afraid to put a needle in. That point in the Chinese martial arts, in the martial arts, they call the dead point. Their body has 36 dead points, which is called the point to kill.

That is the one point. You punch good, you're dead. You're finished.

Shut down all your Qi. Your energetic function will be shut down. Just one touch.

So you are think, who are qualified put the needle into your dead point. I put it this way, you all be scared, right? That's right. But that's why I try.

So that's why you guys feel lucky and here you got a first hand understand. For your safety. This point is very, very, very important.

Control your whole bodies. But this point also will help you to understand they are connected to your heart. Connect to your mental thinking.

Thinking. Your consciousness. Connect to your digestive system.

Connect to your longevity. So when the longevity happens, it's concept is connect to the life source. So this point directly related to the heart.

So we say heart is a deal to outside the situation, right? Heart is a deal four dimensional. Deal your intuition, deal your spirit. So how do you connect to your spirit? That is take care to invisible stuff.

We say visible, invisible. That is the gate to help you connect to the invisible thing. Right? So when we do this one, because this one has a little bit tough way.

So people always say, how to do that? So you have to use your center, your hand. This is your heart also, right? They say heart to heart. Understand this concept? When I say it this way, the center of your palm is a heart.

So that's why when we pray, we put it together, right? Think of this. Why you put this to prayer? You don't put this one to prayer. You don't do this prayer, right? You put this heart to heart.

Your heart with the nature's heart. Heart to heart. You pray from the heart.

You don't pray from the mind. Right? So that's heart to heart. So therefore, you turn around your heart to your heart.

So you connect to that way. So it doesn't matter which hand on the top, which hand on the bottom. But you need the center of this touch this point.

Then you need to make the circles. Right? Make it gently. Make the circles.

So the time has to be long enough. You know, you don't say, oh, I do this two minutes. There's two minutes that can connect if you have a lot of stagnation.

How many life is stagnation? So it takes a year to dig it out, right? So the least, each point, you need at least three to five minutes. Understand what I say? At least three to five minutes. Sometimes it might be need a little bit longer.

So this point very good for your insomnia. So therefore, a lot of people sleeping problem. Right? Your mind cannot peaceful.

So if not sleep well, how can you recharge well? So I highly recommend that you use these postures before go to the bed. You lie down on your back, just continue massage. Right? So that can help you, can improve your sleeping issues.

You might have a very good sound. Number three is your five fingers below your belly button. So here has one issue.

I'm sorry. The belly button, generally speaking, doesn't move. But the five fingers move.

Right? You understand what I say? Because the belly is getting bigger. So therefore, five fingers. And of course, space become curves.

Right? So Einstein never studied this. You know, space become curves. So what are we going to do? Right? That's right.

Space. You know, belly. So that's why we use a belly button to do that.

Then this space has to be a little bit bigger. So that's why this point even is five fingers. Sometimes actually more.

Here will rise the one of the question. Meridian doesn't change. But meridian path change.

The path change. Right? So that's why today so many confused is to say they study acupuncture based on acupuncture chart. Right? You buy the acupuncture chart.

Some good. Some lousy one. But you never see this kind of people.

Why? Because that acupuncture chart is ancient time they do that. It's based on the perfect body, perfect human beings. Today where you can find that kind of perfect human beings? Think.

You don't find the perfect one. You don't find the perfect one in the meridian shake. Meridian changes.

Understand what I say? Your meridian changes. You get a C-section. Your meridian move.

You cut out one thing. Meridian move. You get the knee surgery.

Meridian move. Once move everything move. So that's why meridian shift.

You cannot based on that kind of perfect body try to diagnosis imperfect body patient. You never find it this way. So we only can based on the certain point.

Certain things generally speaking doesn't change much. Understand what I say? Doesn't change much. Like a center here.

You don't gonna change. No matter what. Still here.

When you make the cross. That will be here on the center. No way out.

So that's why we create the body. It's not just powerful. But also doesn't change.

Why doesn't change? Think this way. They are no accidents. Because major point cannot change.

They always are there for right purpose. This one will change. Even though this one is fairly important.

But your life will change. Different ages life. Life will change.

So that one associate with your, called the strength of your life. Your life strength. I can put in the other way.

How about this way? All your immune system. You love this kind of vocabulary. All your immune system.

And based on this point can make a huge major impact. How about that? You will love that kind of concept. My immune system.

Just like a fire. Like the stove. That's your stove.

You put wood there. Let it fire. Let the wood come.

That's lower. Associate your activity. Life activity.

Mental activity. Kidney function. You are all genetic codes.

But definitely associate with also connect to your brain function. Life force. So this point I often give it to the patients.

When they enter to the surgery. They enter to the surgery room. I tell they do the deeper breathing.

Focus on the belly button. Then when they focus the belly button. They also move down here.

This whole area. That's the life force. So if you focus on there.

Do the breathing. Your consciousness will stay there. Even they put you to the anesthesia.

Let you go to sleep. When you wake up. You are still here.

Otherwise when you wake up. You always have a little bit of shift. Some people wake up and they have a lot of shift.

Takes a lot of time to back to the same. Because that spot has problems. So very useful.

Very useful for a lot of patients. Particularly illness, disease. Illness issues.

You want the life. I give you another example. If you want to hold.

You want someone to hold. Because the sun. You know ancient time.

You have to hold a couple of hours. A couple of days. Your sun hasn't come back yet.

What they do? Tell the patient. Focus on here. Focus on here.

Do the breathing. When you focus on here. Your intention.

Your consciousness. All focus on the life source. Stimulated there.

So this engine will continue. Then the ideas. You pull the back to all your energy resource.

Back to the root. May allow you hold on. And save the last light.

Fires waiting for the sun come home. But also can help you get hope. Right? We say if you have 1% chance.

Body will do 100% the miracles. That's the hope. You put the energy there.

Let the marines. If that's yours. Will still can restart.

That's the point. This point sometimes you can put the needle there. Sometimes you can put the heat there.

Because it's a source of the life. Right? But also sometimes cannot put it there. Here is difficult.

So you guys doesn't know. Later. Maybe one day I will teach you.

Teach you when cannot. Sometimes you might accumulate a different kind of heat. Because you do the fire.

Might create other issues. But just have to understand this point. Yes.

You know. You can do the needles. You can do the fires.

They have many useful purpose. So this point is easy. You can hit one hand.

Two hand. Doesn't matter. You just hit it.

You can sit there. You know. You can watch TV.

Do that. You can just in the computer. You still at one hand can do it.

You can drive in the car. Still can do it. Right? So that's called a practice.

A practice. A practice. You have to.

So that's why we created these four simple things. You should try to practice. A practice.

A practice. All right? Whatever you have time. All right? It's very important.

All right. Then go to the last one. They call the Godbrother 36.

That's another unique point. Human body has a couple unique. This is second one.

It's one of the very unique point. On your butt. Everyone.

I think 99% of you guys have this butt hurts. You should find the butt. All right? On your butt.

And the side a little bit. So you know. You move that.

Can't find the spot. You push the hurts. You know.

Hurts is the right. If it doesn't hurts. You didn't find it.

If you find it still doesn't hurts. You need a 911. It is.

Because that spot has to be stimulate you. It's very important. That's one of the major.

Think of this. One of the major intersection. Think of the highway.

It's a major intersection. Your whole body is a major intersection through here. Upper body and the lower body intersection.

Which is upper body, lower body balance. Everything is based on this point. 99% of time.

And the 99% of people. This spot is blocked. 99%.

Blocked. So because of called a stagnation. Many years.

Many issues. Cause the energy. Very difficult through this spot.

So therefore. They will have so many kind of hip repair. Lower back pain.

Sometimes even upper back pain. It's that spot blocked. All right.

This spot. It's a God brother. And the brothers.

Intersection. Two of the human body. The largest the Marines.

Largest the energy lines. Cross here. Called the intersection.

Intersection is one of the most interesting concept. Intersection. So that's why people.

Most of the time they don't understand. Why you cannot just do acupuncture. Acupuncture do something wrong.

Can cause the problems. I make a joke here. All right.

I have a patient come in. He said, Dr. Lu. I'm open mind.

I'm very open mind. So I want to try. I want to try.

I want to try herb first. No, I try acupuncture first. I'm not try your herb.

Let me experience. I say you are open mind. Why you are not try herb? You try acupuncture.

Well, acupuncture my doctor say you can do that. I say your doctor doesn't understand acupuncture. So I tell you.

If acupuncture do the wrong. Point no return. If herb doing wrong.

It has a point no return. You can return. Do you understand? If herb take wrong.

You can go to the emergency room. And wash out. If acupuncture do the wrong.

You total screw. Because acupuncture do the wrong. It's destroyed your soft way.

Soft way be destroyed. If herb did wrong. Only hard way be terminate.

Or be poison. The poison is wash out. But the soft way destroyed.

Point no return. So what is that means? Think this whole concept. Intersection.

Think this intersection. You guys understand whole thing. I give a bad experience.

A bad example. Think this way. If someone come in.

To complain. Say I have a back pain. Think this.

It's a back pain. So the back pain. Can be associated with a bladder function.

Based on the location. We say it's a bladder. Bladder function.

So if a bladder function. I can deal the bladder Marines. Bladder function disorder.

I deal the bladder Marines. I can deal the problem. Make sense? I deal the bladder.

But someone learn the many different kind of trick. Some doctor teach this. You need to go to this point.

Intersection point. So the intersection means. Here can turn.

Energy come to here. Have a chance to spread. Either continue on the bladder.

Or they can go to the gallbladder. Right? Called intersection. Highway you come here.

You can have a chance. Now at the beginning. I have a back pain.

It's caused by cold. Right? Outside the cold. I have a headache.

I catch a cold. Caused my back pain. I have a fever.

Right? It's a back pain and a bladder issue. Now I put the needles into here. Intersection.

So what's that mean? I guide this cold essence go to the gallbladder. Opens. I open the door.

Call the thief. Come in. You can get out.

But thief come in doesn't want to go out. Your house is so beautiful. Why I'm going to go out? I stay here.

Everything is mine. Whatever yours is yours. No.

Whatever mine is mine. Right? Thief doesn't want to go out. Once you introduce.

The cold goes to the gallbladder. It doesn't want to go out. Now you're guiding the intersection.

Condition go to the other place. So that's why sometimes acupuncture is so dangerous. You do the wrong.

Cause the function disorder. And you never make sense. You never will understand.

Think of this. After these needles. Right? Sometimes immediately.

Sometimes it can be next day. You suddenly cannot eat any kind of cheese. Any kind of things.

You know greedy things. You cause the stomach ache. You will never understand why.

Cold goes to the gallbladder. Anything cold come in. You cannot digest.

Digest the issue. Immediately show up. You will never make the connection.

Then you go to the. GR doctors try to think of this way. No.

Because that spot. You open the gate. You know don't think that the acupuncture is just nothing.

You know I always tell patients. If you want to try Chinese medicine. Try herb first.

How far they can go. Think of this way. Try herb first.

You know. If you try acupuncture. Do not try acupuncture.

You know acupuncture more dangerous. You know particularly you. You watch all the magazines.

They put in them acupuncture all face. You go there. Why you don't put it here? I saw the magazine New York Times.

Put it here. Here. Why is it here? Third eyes.

When someone put a needle to the third eyes. Do they guarantee your third eye can still open? They might shut off your third eyes. You never chance open again.

Right? Think this way. It's a third eyes. You just have to be careful certain things.

You know don't think that acupuncture. Oh that's no scientific. You know scientific base.

That doesn't make sense. Acupuncture do not. Don't worry.

This is just a needle. No. They real can do something.

It's a famous in the Chinese Bible. Not Chinese. Herbal Bible.

Right? Neijing. They have 10 words. Very important.

Very, very. Meridians. They call them meridians.

Control the life. All your life be controlled by meridians. Meridians can control the life.

Can heal all the disease. You must. You must understand.

That's in Neijing. Tell any doctors you want to study this. That's 10 words.

The meridians. Control the life. Heal all the disease.

Heal all the disease. You must truly understand. Call it truly understand.

Or you have to. Or you call it you must. Whatever the English can be.

Make you exciting. Truly understand what they can do. It's very serious.

You understand? You know very serious. Can make your change. Because we say the beginning.

At the beginning we say that to you. You have one. The most important life.

Your life is based on the meridians. Understand? It's not based on these organs. It's based on your meridians.

Because that meridians allow you connect to the life source. See? That's the connections. That's your internet.

That's your high speed internet. You must. You must.

Take care of this internet. If you appreciate it. If you love yourself.

Right? So that's why meridians is very important. These four energy gate is allow you through this kind of gate. Stimulate the meridians.

See? So the gate itself help yours. Now, I want everybody think of this. The gate set up is complete for the physical ways.

It's balance. First, they deal the two gates. One is on the top.

One is on the bottom. Right? At your center lines. It's on the center lines.

The other two at where? Hand and here. The other balance. And the leg and the hand.

You look at it. It's a complete balance structure. The point itself already create a balance structure.

And the geography create all the organs. Now, let's go back to business. We only focus on the stomach and the liver.

Right? These two organs say that's our cutting. The gate, we go in. I know you have questions.

How do we deal other organs? You're missing the other part. Right? No, we are not missing the other part. We use the full energy gate, make all these connect together.

See? So this way, I want you, you guys can do something. And you also can give your patients can do something. Right? So therefore, you are not just give the fish.

You are teaching your patient how to fishing. Because you give the tools to help your patient can heal themselves. Can do themselves energy exercise.

That's what you needed to do. So full energy gate, you see, which organ we didn't cover? Everything. All your name is already covered.

All the kidneys, the gallbladder, the lungs, the heart. They all covered by this full energy gate. So therefore, you are unique in this five element consciousness framework.

You covered it. You never missing anything. You go beyond it.

Right? That is what you, at the beginning, you have to do that. The more you do that, the more disappoint, more sensitive. Think of this.

It's called light connect to the light. Always light connect to the light. If your large intestine, which is gate number one, more sensitive.

Once I connect to you, once I shake a hand, your this gate will automatically jump up waiting for me. Do you understand the concept? It's the same way I share the same frequency. Large intestine is what? It's a metal.

It's a metal element. My metal element connect to the metal element outside the source. Your metal element connect to outside source.

Even though we don't have a blood line, so we don't connect, but we go like the same source. So through this kind of triangle, same source, we connect. Now my colon, large intestine, if more strong, will stimulate you immediately say, hey, that's hope.

He can do that. I should be able to do that at the consciousness level. Understand? So become mirror.

Become encourage. Encourage without the words. That's the beauty.

Invisible way. You use energy. You use universal love.

Through your invisible mirror. You say, I love my patients. How do you love your patients? Through your mind or through your heart? You say, I through my heart.

So how can you let your heart function? Let this point function more. So here, energy will come out. You see that, understand? How can I give my patients, I have a hope.

Life will be continue. You have to show your life continues. How can I let my patient see? It's a balance.

Your upper body, lower body, your whole body has to be balanced. You have to be stand up for yourself. You are number three.

Number four, the gate has to be open. You can stand straight. You can have a backbone.

It's all about you. So this four energy gate can give you have something. Allow you discover yourself.

Then you be able to give to someone. Allow them can give themselves. Then the light can pass to the light.

Hope pass to the hope. Life will pass to the life. Continues.

So that's the whole purpose of the four energy gate. Simple, easy. Only four.

You can do this. You will have energy balance. Once you have a balance, you'll be able to use this concept, Xiao Dao concept.

And these two will be more powerful. Because what? The other three all be included. Even though they are not really used at a different way, but they are included.

It's their background. They support you. Right? They are part of the team.

Never left. I think you got enough.
