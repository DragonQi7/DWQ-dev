Wow! That's what they need to do, right? Okay. So is everybody here? Can we... We're going to start. So we started earlier.

We can end early. No, we can end later. So we bought... We buy time, right? We know time is very important.

There's always a time and a space. Time is money, right? There's only one kind of profession can create more time. Lawyer.

That's right, right? Lawyer can charge you 26 hours a day. How come? You know, we only have 24 hours a day. They can charge you extra more.

I said, how can they manifest the time? That's a great way to manifest the time. So talk about the time, right? It's in this class and also out of this class. So in this class, we talk about the time.

So we often think of the time as a classical way. In the traditional way, we talk about the time as a lineage, right? I want everybody to think of the time as completely different ways. Completely different ways.

Completely different ways is time associated with the processing. Processing. Time and associated accumulation.

But also time associated with your feelings, your emotions. Think of it this way. Just think of it this way.

If someone asks you, what is the best thing that you've done in the last 10 days? Each one. Last 10 days, tell me one exciting thing for you. Four things.

Each one can pick up the different things, right? 10 days, how many hours? Every day 24 hours, so 10 days, what? 240 hours. 240 hours. How many things, events, happens in these 10 days? Now why you pick up a specific day, that things, maybe seven days ago, what's happening? Everything disappear.

All the sequence is based on your feeling. You got it? Your feeling manipulate the whole past time. If you can discover that too, do you know how much power you can gain back? How much power you can gain back? Think of it this way.

If I going to ask you, just like I ask the patient, usually when I do the form, I say, give me the one of the most crazy things what you've done in the past. Most crazy. And other people, particularly in other people's eyes, thinking you are crazy, you are nuts, but you don't care.

You just do that. Think of it this way. Now, you have to think of this concept.

What is that concept going to help you? Guts. Right? Feelings. Maybe 20 years ago, maybe 50 years ago, and 50 years ago, that time, you doesn't care.

Any kind of consequence, any kind of rational mind will say yes or no, you just don't care. What you care is your own feelings, your heart, right? We say, listen to your heart. And that moment, you are listening to your heart.

Just take action. Do you know what's the power of that kind of action? You don't care. You did by the moment.

The feeling is the moment, you understand what I say? In the western way, we always want to ask you, we always, I always hear the patient asking, you know, people, I want a free will. Can I get a free will? I say yes. If you listen to the moment, you have a free will.

The moment will allow you have a freedom. If you are not in this moment, you are based on the past, you never have a freedom. If you are based on the future, you also don't have a freedom.

Only in this moment, you will have a freedom. Because this moment will allow you connect to the past and connect to the future. Because the moment is the turning point.

So when you ask someone, what is the most exciting, crazy things what you've done in the past? What is the moment? You don't care, right? The moment you waiting to just jump in, take action. And that guts, if you can help someone bring back, then that guts, that feelings will accomplish, will breakthrough, will heal everything. Nothing will stop you.

If you use that kind of feeling for cancer, for disease, then what kind of disease? Will stop you. Think of this. You even waiting to jump out of your school, you waiting, even waiting doesn't care your parents kick you out the house, you jump out the window and sneak out, still take the guy cross the country.

You don't care, right? For love. Think of this, right? How many people say, are you nuts, you go with him? You don't care. Right? How many of this kind of story? It's a true story, right? You can, each one of you know your friend did this crazy things, right? Or maybe you did a lot more crazy things, right? You just have to think.

The most crazy things what you did, is the most powerful moment you listen to your heart. So which is the question what she asking, how do you know you listen to your heart? The most crazy things, you always listen to heart. Because the most crazy is not the rational mind, it's the interior mind.

Interior mind, always connect to your heart. Rational mind, always connect to your mind. It's not your heart.

We say heart can create heaven, heart can create hell. Right? The heart is the natural law. So that's why you go to the heart disease, why yesterday we said the heart is connected to the outside space.

Not the deal for this reality. The heart is deal. Any other reality download the information can deal in this reality.

So if we listen to the heart, how do you know that is not from the other reality? You download the information tell you, you should do that. But the rational mind say no. But interior mind say yes.

Right? You are struggle. Which way is good? So once you struggle, most of the time, and most of the time, rational mind win. Right? You see? Most of the time rational mind win.

Then couple years later, what's happening? You feel sorry. You're depressed. Right? You're holding the sadness.

So you suppress the feelings. Then you go to the second thing. Then second time, you're still afraid.

You're not good. Then because you become bad habit. Then one after the other, one after the other.

What's happening? You accumulate negative, whatever called suppression. Cancer. Then this cancer, sooner or later, you will create other kind of show.

Whatever we call it today, illness and disease. Because that's the way you can draw your attention. This way you can make your feeling you have to change.

Right? Yesterday, we talk about one thing called the genetic cancer. Everyone is genetic. We're born with the body.

With the ancestors, you have all the blood lines come down. Genetic, they are always carry on for big purpose. Even though we say genetic virus, you know, genetic disease.

Think of this way. Right? Genetic disease. You carry one very, very nasty genetic disease.

But genetic disease, before turn it to the disease, it's a gold. It's a diamond. It's priceless.

Because of that disease itself, it's priceless. It's genetic. Because we say one of the rules in this spiritual journey is they are no accidents.

Among all of these genetic issues, why you pick up this one? Think about the positive way. I give you a positive thinking. Like your grandmother, before she died, she give you one beautiful jewelry.

Then she tell you the story that your grandmother say that piece of jewelry is passed down for her grandmothers. So the generation to generation, the beautiful jewelry is passed down for generation to generations. It's priceless.

So you keep this one for memory, for love. Right? So if your life is good, you will continue to keep this one as the secret way, as a sleeper way to carry this. That means your life is good.

Suppose if your life turned to the sour. You're bankrupt. You don't have money.

Something going on. So what's going on? You have to sell this piece, right? Think of this way. If something get bad, you have to go to the jail.

You need $10,000 to allow you get out. What you want to sell? You have to sell this one. So now you think of this.

Genetic, pass the generation to generation. Can be used for good. Can be used for bad.

Depending on when you want to use. How do you want to use? That's just a concept. It's the same concept when we have a genetic illness, genetic carry in the body.

It's like that jewelry. Depending on how do you want to use. If you have nothing to do, you won't use the genetic disease because they're just a jewelry.

Keep it there to allow other things to come down. You think of this, right? As of today, we're always thinking, you know, at the Western concept, they say immune system is the most important thing. All the disease, illness is caused by your immune system out of control.

Your immune system fail. In the Chinese medicine, they never bother to talk about the immune system. They think immune system is useless.

Think of this way. I give you a concept. Immune system is like a security guard, hotel security guard.

It's immune system. What's the immune system can do? What do they can do? All they can do is to carry the walkie-talkie, drink the Starbucks coffee, and walk around and tell people, yes, I'm going to check the basement, and the door is not locked. They are security guard.

Even though they might carry the gun, but they would pull the gun too slow if a real bad guy there, they will run first. Because they are not trained for fight. Think of this way.

You're right. Immune system is not. Your own virus, all inside the genetic, they are more powerful.

Any kind of virus, anything is getting, they are 10 times more smart. So that's why they can sneak, go through the genetic, right? They can go through your security guard, which is immune system. Otherwise, immune system already blocking all this problem now.

Why cannot? See? Immune system is just a security guard. They are not trained for fight. They train for show.

Normal things they can do. Right? Normal things. What's called normal things? We think, okay, what's called normal things? Fruit shot.

It's immune system. You get a fruit shot. Does a fruit shot really prevent the fruit? Answer is no.

Everybody knows. But you still have to shot. Everybody need a security guard.

Security guards look like they have. Does real can do something? No, just make you think they can do something. Right? The real disease, they are not a security guard.

They are Navy SEAL. They are 10 times more fast, 10 times more powerful. So real can happen inside your body.

Don't blame your immune system, it's a lousy immune system. Because they are not trained for fight. They are trained for show.

Understand what I say? I hope everybody can flip this concept. Think about it. When you look good, when you feel good, how do they say? Oh, you have a good immune system.

It's true? No, right? It's not true, but you can connect. See, I didn't get sick. Everybody catch a cold.

I don't catch a cold because I have a good immune system. No, it's not whole true. It's just a piece of the truth.

So that's why Eastern medicine Chinese men never bother doing immune system. It's nothing there. So they think immune system is not your genetic code.

It doesn't belong to your genetic. It's not that you're born with this. Right? It's like a hotel after hotel build up.

Security guard is one of the employees. They have the highest security guard, right? So if they need to cut the budget, who would they cut first? Cleaning lady and the security guard because they are not real need. Because all they need is to put one more camera down.

Think of this. The security guard is very important. It's the same kind of immune system.

It's called the immune system. Immune we think can defend ourselves. No.

If you get a balance, your body itself knows how to manage it. Right? The body, harmony and the balance, each organ. Yesterday we said each organ has their own law, own rule, own consciousness.

Right? If each organ can follow their own rule, then each organ can reach the highest balance. When the body get a balance, where's the disease? Where's the criminals? Where's the violence? No one want to come in because it's a balance. It's good.

They don't like it here. Just like today we have this kind of talk. If they don't like it, who want to sit here and listen to my BS? No one want that.

It's too boring. They walk away. Right? Whatever you want to sit here because it's interesting.

How simple is it? It's the natural way. If the body get a balance and then disease doesn't want to stay there because disease want more exciting. Right? If not exciting, who's going to go there? So the question become here.

We have a choice. So the whole shout out concept is I wonder you guys have to change your mind. Don't focus on the, hey, defense system.

I need this kind of immune system. So you have to continue build. Right? You try to build this.

You build your immune system stronger. The illness still know how to sneak in. Never can block.

They are ten times more fast, more smart. Right? Don't bother this way. All you need is just how can I follow the natural law.

We'll go, we'll bigger season after season. Every season knows if the time is my time, I'm going to come. Every nature knows the next season come.

If I don't prepare, I don't have a food. If I'm not going to prepare enough roots go down, next year I don't have enough nutrients. Nutrients, they know.

But we don't know. We based on the fear. So we're running around, do other things.

So we're missing the point. Right? So we learn here and then we say, hey, we shout out, how can I use? Sound is great. The sound is a promise.

I promise you. I never promise anything. So you cannot promise someone because tomorrow is a mystery.

Right? But you have to really listen to your guts. You want this, I will put it there. If you want, if you want, go down to the natural way.

But natural way has natural way rules. If you don't want to go down natural way, go down the other way, then the other way has the other way's rules. It is a complimentary, yes, but become complimentary is the highest level.

So that's why Tao become more difficult. Tao is not easy. What is Tao? Tao is between good and bad.

Not to be good. Good is not Tao. Bad also is not good Tao.

It's not Tao. It's between called Tao. The criminal love me, police love me.

See, that's called Tao. Work only between. Gray is called Tao.

The black is not Tao. The white is not Tao. So real Tao, the natural is the Tao.

That's called Tao. Nature, think this way. Nature is itself.

Doesn't mean it has to be good or bad because just itself. But both way need it. There's always someone like it.

So work only between, follow the natural way. Call the natural way. You want the natural way, you have to apply the natural rule into the system.

So that's why we try to teach. I try to pass this concept to you. So you want to go down this path, so you have to follow the natural path, natural law.

Body can heal itself. Right? If body can heal itself, what is the requirement? So that's why I say. So if you allow that each organ can meet the requirement, then the body can heal itself.

Right? You want to go down this natural path, so you have to understand everything's energy. All the energy has a consciousness and all the consciousness has a purpose. So if everything's energy, so we can fool the energetic energy point of view, so you look at the energy point of view, then disease, illness, symptoms, events, object and subject, all of these things can translate as energy.

Once we translate as the energy, then events become consciousness. See? Today that's called events, right? You guys say subject or object or whatever you want to call it. Events.

Today's events become consciousness. Then today's consciousness becomes purpose. Then what is the purpose? What's my purpose? What is your purpose? What is our purpose? Think of what I say.

What is your purpose? What is my purpose? What is our purpose? Then what is the natural purpose? So through this purpose, we can connect together. We can connect to the natural law. So this purpose become connect to the natural law.

But connect to the natural law is not the final purpose, right? Why I need to connect natural law? My law is better than natural law. I'm above the law. Why you need the natural law? Natural law, I don't getting sick.

My life is beautiful, right? So the natural law will lead us have a good life. Have a beautiful life. So the beautiful life is a purpose.

Got it? See, we want to, who want to suffer here? Please, raise your hand. Why not? Why you don't raise your hand? I thought you all want to suffer. See, no one want to suffer.

See, who want to have a beautiful life? Everybody raise your hand because we want to have a beautiful life. See, that's the purpose, right? So we want to have a beautiful life. So that's the whole purpose.

So how to get the purpose? That's the consciousness. Your consciousness, my consciousness, our consciousness, nature consciousness. So therefore, we are filled into the big consciousness.

That's the whole purpose, right? The one person by yourself is not strong enough. So if we create energy field, we'll be much stronger. So even our energy field still not strong, but if we can follow the natural law, we don't have to do anything, right? Think of this.

If you need to drive the car across the country, how difficult? It's not too difficult if you're a good driver, good car. But think this way. If your car carry on the train, the train cross the country, what do you need to do? You don't have to do anything, right? Because you know your destiny will be at California.

All you need is just enjoy watching the views. And it doesn't have to worry about the gas, doesn't have to worry about the last chance to see the name, you go through the desert, you need to fill up the gas. Right? You don't have to worry.

So that's why I say if we can carry on to the natural law, the season will take us to change. So we don't have to do anything. Think of this.

Otherwise, you have to clean, right? Think of this, a fall. I think a fall, a lot of leaves fall down. We have to grow the leaves, right? If a lot of wind, do we need to grow the leaves? We don't, they grow to the neighbors.

Right? Because the wind blow up, right? So you call your neighbors, hey, don't come today, it's clean. Because yesterday is a windy day. Right? You don't have to do anything.

So we have to be smart. Right? In my opinion, if we follow this concept, we are pretty smart, we don't have to do anything. All we need to follow the natural law.

But to follow the natural law, you need guts. Guts. You need guts.

You need to believe, because it's a challenge to you. It's the rational mind and the intuitive mind. So you have to really go back to this concept.

Does it make sense? You know, if it makes sense, you have to try. At least you have to try. Slowly try.

Try slowly. You know, little by little, will become yours. Otherwise, still not yours, still is mine.

It's information. It's data. You have to turn this information, become wisdom.

Become yours. Otherwise, it's just almost like you just, you know, keep this kind of recipe, called the cooking recipes. It's cooking recipes.

Right? Every time you follow the recipe, cook, doesn't taste good. Right? Doesn't taste. It's a recipe.

The data is the data. Knowledge is knowledge. Useless.

Right? You have to apply. So how to apply? Today, we're going to talk about. How are we going to apply this concept? You know, a lot of questions.

I know yesterday, you do this, I talk about that. You know, people are wondering, how am I going to use this? How do I use this? Right? Go back to the Shelldog concept. So if we go back to the Shelldog concept, what is the Shelldog concept? Shelldog concept.

The first thing you need to show, right? Elimination. Right? Something should go out. You need to just let it go.

Digest. Right? Dispute that. And the peel off.

So you ask yourself. You should ask yourself. Does anything you digest? How do you know your digestive system is not functioning right? One of the very simple things.

I give it to everybody. When in the morning you get up, what is the first thing you do? Coffee? Good. Shower? What else? First thing you should go to the bathroom.

You have to let it go first before it can receive. That's natural law. Always.

Out. In. You want to eat more, you have to out more.

Before received, you have to let it go. In the Tao Te Ching, always say that. Before received, you have to let it go.

Your cup has to be empty. Then you might can catch the water. Right? You have to empty yourself.

So if in the morning you get up, you know all first things you go. Yeah, you can take shower first. But you still have to go.

If you can go, you know your system. Digestive system. At least at one of the elimination part.

Shower is good. Understand what I say? If it doesn't go, you have to constipate it. You have to drink the pung juice.

You have to smoke to go there. That means you need additional help. The natural way doesn't go.

You need additional help. So that give you a sign. Say, hey, my digest system is not function perfectly.

I need additional help. It doesn't move smoothly. Doesn't move smoothly.

Stuck there. So if it's stuck there, you have to see. Often what we say, oh, I eat lousy food last night.

We go out, eat a buffet. You know, that food is not organic. It's not gluten free.

I'm allergic to the gluten. You immediately can penetrate a food because that's easy to penetrate. Right? You will never think about it because I have one sub project still stuck in the mind.

You know, I'm fighting for my brothers, for our grandmother's house or something. You know, he want to sell. I don't want to sell.

See? You never will thinking because emotions processing will cause your body processing not smoothly. We often thinking digest the system just for the food. Here we already tell you digest the system is not just for food.

We go back to the five elements. When we say that digest, think in, goes to the earth. If earth just for food, how can society change generation to generation? How can kingdom to kingdom? Earth will say, oh, human, I should send it to the outer space.

That's not belong to me or I am earth. I only do the food. Earth doesn't say at the end you die, I kick you out to the earth, send you to the moon.

You bury on the moon, right? Everything can bury in the earth. You can digest, right? Earth will digest you and processing you. You will turn it to the fertilizer of the trees, of the other things the birds will eat, continue change.

Then birds carry your consciousness. Then you don't have to see the eagle eye. You can see through the eagle eye.

That's sci-fi, you know, movies, right? So, but at the consciousness level makes sense. Consciousness level makes sense. In this level maybe not make sense.

But you still have to see this because your digestive system is earth. They are not just for food. In this emotions, the Chinese call, Chinese medicine call this earth.

In the earth consciousness way they are related to the feeding. They call the thought, thinking. Your emotions all belong to the stomach.

So that's why you are overthinking, over worrying. All the emotional processing based on your stomach. So if that emotions based on the stomach.

Now follow me. If emotions based on the stomach. If you continue processing these emotions and say it again, again, again.

So if you see your patients next week come back still complain the same stuff again, again, again. What do you see? Definitely he or she has a stomach issue, right? Even though there's emotional issue. But still can be penetrate at the physical issue.

It's a digestive system issue, right? So therefore, if you are a therapist, you are not just seeing that's emotional problem. You know that emotions already impact to the physical issue now, right? See, energy and matter are interchangeable. So if the patients digest the system stronger, he or she be able to digest emotions much faster, much easier.

So that give you a different angle to understand emotions are related to the stomach, to the physical level. Just the physical level and the emotional level, they are interchangeable, right? If you cannot let it go, I give you another example. You have a patient coming in, right? So you suddenly see your patient.

You are a therapist. I'm just a therapist. You see the patients, you know, come here, they hang, you know, get the booze.

You know, big booze. They say, what's happening? Your husband or your boyfriend beat you up? No, he loves me. So now why you get it? Oh, because I'm easy to get the booze.

I'm easy to get the booze. So yesterday, because I opened the door, I touched the doughnuts and then caused this. Now think of it, right? You are a therapist.

It has nothing to do with this. You're supposed to send it to the physical therapist or send it to the sport injuries, right? But you learned today in the Xiao Dao concept. We learned this for the liver.

Liver, this organ can control the blood, can control the flow, can control the qi. Even though you have a blood stagnation at the here, the blood also can be related to this. But you see that because your body processing, digest, energy flow too slow.

Sluggish, we call sluggish liver function. So cause the body difficult to processing this kind of impact. The cause, blood clot.

How simple is? Now you understand one thing. Even though that's not in your field, but we will give you a concept, you are a therapist. You will understand that patients also has a liver issue.

It's not just has a liver issue, also will have a stomach issue. That's two organs already is not a function in harmony. So no matter what you're going to talk, if that physical level not get a balance, emotional very difficult to get in.

Because emotions and the physical body's function are interconnected. You cannot separate. So you have to see the big pictures.

Yesterday, we talk about many different concepts are related to Xiao Dao. The one of the major things which Xiao you have to eliminate, which is associated with the digestive system, but also to eliminate this concept is called let it go. But also in the let it go, this is eliminated.

It's out of your body, right? Out, right? Digest is out. Everything is from something become nothing, right? Think of this. If you ask the center, so digest means take it away, right? Something has to be out, has to be move, has to be move out of you.

So if that's the concept, no matter what, that's always also related to the pieces of the liver function, right? Liver function also we say that yesterday, we say that what? Has to be one, let it go. Flow, your blood flow, your energy flow, your qi flow are all related. To the liver function.

Let me say it one more time. This sentence is a very important concept. We know if we do this way, our body can be energy body, which is a material substance or energy body, which is a qi we cannot see.

So we merge these two visible, invisible together become human bodies, blood and the qi, right? We can say that there's two things. You have a blood flow inside your veins. You have a qi flow inside your bodies.

In order blood flow freely, you need the qi. Without the qi, blood cannot flow. Without the blood, the qi doesn't accumulate.

So qi and the blood has interrelationship. So there are many different sentence we show our physical body. Either you have a qi stagnation, qi stuck.

What is a qi stuck? Think of this concept. Qi stuck. Does anyone experience the qi stuck? No? You have a gas pain.

Think of this. I have a gas pain. Something hold there.

Oh, oh, and then burp. Burp. Oh, pain go away.

Right? That's exactly qi stuck. I give you another example called the qi stuck. Right? Have you seen people? Achoo! How can your sneeze cause your back be out of whack? Think of this.

You go to physical therapy, they will never figure out this. It will be immediately come. Oh, that's the bladder function disorder.

Because the qi is stuck in that, you sneeze, then the meridians cause the back pain. Think of this. How simple is that? People, achoo! Sneeze.

Oh, they get accidents. Right? You see a lot of people also today. They cannot smile.

They cannot achoo. They cannot. They accidents.

Why? That's called the qi stuck. You don't have qi. Hold it.

It's energy. It's all about energy. It has nothing physical things.

Right? You can. That's called the qi stuck. So what is called the blood stuck? One's blood stuck because the blood is materialized.

Anything materialized is blood stuck. What's called materialized? Tumor. Materialized.

Right? Cancer is materialized. Blood clot is materialized. Right? That's materialized.

So once you have materialized things, that's called blood stuck. So here has something else. Some kind of stuck include both.

And the qi stuck and also blood stuck. And the qi and the blood both are there. What is? Here is most women will experience that.

If your menstrual cycle come, your breast tenderness, that's qi and the blood, both are stuck. Right? Every month, lots of months, have a busy time, has a stress time. These months, oh, so painful.

Painful. Pain. Pain.

Most likely associated with the blood. Most likely. Blood.

Blood stuck will cause the pain. So that's why it's so needle pain. The qi stuck is a kind of dull pain.

Right? So that when the blood, you know, when the breast tenderness, you cannot touch. You have both. Right? Once your blood come, your menstrual cycle come, then pain go away.

How can your blood come and the pain will go away? Think of this. Does it make sense? Yeah, for someone, it would never make sense. But if you use this qi and the blood stagnation concept, it makes sense.

It's perfect sense. Right? So that's give you a concept here. It's the blood and the qi.

So important. And the two things together. So we talk about the liver.

Control all the flow. Even though we say the stomach do this kind of limitation. Right? Digest.

The both still connect each other. The both create something different. Now I'm going to take you to each organs differently.

We'll go to the digest system. When we talk about the digest system, often we also think about stomach. Right? Because the stomach is the element of the earth.

It's the element of the earth. So therefore, stomach has to be follow element of the earth. Understand here now? It's not a stomach law.

It's the earth elements law. Now take your stomach to the next level. Think your stomach like this entire earth.

The earth has earth law. The element of the earth law. In this earth, how many years? How many years that this earth exist? That anyone knows? We don't know.

We think we know. Then we just dump it because a big bang happens. Are you sure? Maybe.

Right? That's not our business. We don't care. Doesn't matter.

But at least the existing many, many, many, many, many years. So if existing many, many, many years. They go through the many, many, many, many years.

The processing by just life. So therefore, in this earth accumulate wisdom. Consciousness.

How can earth digest life? Earth life. Right? Earth has life. Earth be part of our galaxy.

Right? Earth be part of this system in this, in our solar system. So earth has to meet the requirement. Otherwise, sun will kick earth out.

Earth already burn out. So the earth already meet the requirement. So that's why life can grow in the earth.

If life can grow in the earth. Societies, lives, humans, natures, animals. How many stuff all can grow in this earth? So apply this kind of consciousness into your stomach.

Into your digestive system. What things cannot grow? Beauty for the canyons. Can bury everything.

Millions in there. Millions years. Still staying there.

If you have depression. If you have anxiety. I will highly recommend you go there.

You stand in front of the canyon. What else you cannot let go? Compared for that view. Nothing will bother you.

It will dissolve all your stress. Because of the views. The beauties.

The spirits. Right? That's called the spirit of the earth. Called the spirit.

Make you connect. You merge into that kind of spirit. Then your stomach will function in that spirit.

Then definitely. This one compared for that one. It's called the natural law.

This human law. But the human law still is the natural law. Think this way.

I'm just saying. Right? Because we are part of the nature. So therefore we still as nature law.

It's different. Still it's natural law. But in this natural law.

Let me find a way. The walls of feng shui buildings. I'm sorry.

I shouldn't say it that way. Let me see here. This one.

I know. I think it's. I don't know.

That's the one. There are a couple of buildings. It's called energetic way.

It's called nasty. Nasty. This is called nasty buildings.

It's bad energy. They build this building. Never look at the harmony.

Their energy is to try to destroy the other building's energy. It's bad. It's for feng shui.

For the energetic harmony. That's a bad design. Right? So I'm sorry.

I shouldn't say it this way. But anyway. That still is the different kind.

Different kind of society. Which one here? I don't know. I didn't see it here.

This picture doesn't have. This picture doesn't have. It's not on this.

I didn't see it. It's not here. Yeah.

I took a couple of pictures. You know, when I walk on the street. I see.

Oh, that's one day when I do the feng shui. Talk about this geometry. I will point out.

It's not a good. It's not a good. It's not a good called harmony.

Type of the building. Idea is that the building. You cannot build up like a knife.

Like a point. You understand? They're so sharp. And when the sun shining there.

That's just like a knife. Cut off. From the other side.

So any building on the other side. Will get more anxiety. Anyone.

As sit in that office. With anxiety. Depressed.

And anger. Always. You even don't know why they get angry.

Because in this building. But. For the energy.

Always. Both way. Right? They're angry.

At the mind. They never know. Who did it.

But in the consciousness level. They always know. Who did it.

So they're always cursing. In the design. Because in the consciousness level.

You know. So whoever designed. In these buildings.

The designer. Will have a lot. Bad nightmares.

At the consciousness level. Yeah? So that's why they say. You know.

In the classical consciousness. That way. Do not think.

You don't see. Is not exist. Above.

Above your head. There's always someone. Watching you.

That's the Chinese say that way. Because based on the consciousness. Now you know.

It's true. Anyway. Because the earth.

There's so many human beings. Who can live in this earth. We can process in this earth.

We can go through that. We can go through the food. We can go through this.

But no matter where they go. Right? That's the earth consciousness. But once attended to the human body.

You have the spirit of the earth. Understand what I say? It's the spirit of the earth. But.

But. Here I put the but. You still have to follow.

In the human bodies. One of the rules. In order this.

Stomach organ. Function. Not here.

Function perfectly. There's two issues. You have to.

Follow. Which is two things. The stomach doesn't like it.

Number one. It's a cold. Number two.

It's a dampness. We start the cold first. The cold.

Have two phases. One phase is called the materialized phases. Which is we can use the temperature.

We can measure that. We can see the cold. Right? Outside now.

30 degree. You can see. That's cold.

Right? Degrees. You can imagine. The other kind of cold.

Called essence. Essence cold. What is essence cold? I give you example.

Suppose tomorrow. Temperature change. It become 50 degrees.

Suppose tomorrow 50 degrees. You will see. A lot of people.

They cannot wait. They wear the shirt. Immediately running around.

Right? Because the temperature is 50. At that time. You should stand there.

And pass your business card. I can't help you. They say.

Give me break. They will throw it away. Right? They say.

See me tomorrow. Why? Because you see the tomorrow. Right? Today.

Temperature is high. Essence. Still cold.

The person. If they against the natural law. They will get the essence of the cold.

Called the essence of the cold. Getting into the body. So here.

If you. Now go back to what we call the immune system. Right? If your body inside.

Not strong. Then outside. Will easy get in.

Understand it here? If you are strong. You don't need it. So what's called a strong? Think what I say.

Qi. Right? When we was young. You all young before.

That time. This kind of weather. You don't have to wear these things.

Right? Look at the young kid. High school. All young kid.

Nothing. I look at this. I see myself.

I say yes. Oh if I know that time. I won't do that.

Right? That time. So dumb. I think it's so dumb.

You know. To challenge the weather. Think I'm tough.

I can do. Oh. So dumb.

Waste. It's a waste of energy. Now I feel sorry.

Because I spend earlier. I spend. Why total is the same.

You spend too early. Later you don't have. But at the young.

We spend. We don't care. Right? At the young.

Who cares? You guys don't care too. I can see that. I can see through your wrinkles.

I'm sorry. I shouldn't say that. I can see which part.

You know. Disappear first. You know.

Same. We abused. With that time.

We don't know. We don't think this way. Right? Who we think about that.

You know. I have to save a little bit of energy for my future. They always think I can make more.

Right? Just like money. You cannot make more. Doesn't do that way.

You don't. We don't meet the requirement. We don't make more.

It's gone. It's gone forever. Right? We're always thinking they have a second chance.

There's no such a thing. Based on the quantum concept. Based on this energy concept.

There's no such a thing. Second chance. Moment to moment.

Every moment is the new life. Right? So, anyway. So, we don't need to discuss that part yet.

So, go to the cold first. Right? Cold. Two issues.

The first issue. Temperature. Essence.

Talk about this. Then you will understand in today's our western life. Think of it.

Ice water back. Everywhere is ice. Right? Even that cold weather.

You still put ice. You go to a restaurant. Ice water emitting.

Ice. Ice. Ice.

Ice water give you two things. Right? Temperature. At least the temperature.

Ice has to be zero degree. Right? Otherwise, it never turn into the ice. Already too cold.

Right? Stomach doesn't like cold. If stomach too cold. Now, go to this.

If you meet the requirement of the cold. What happen? Now, the second stuff. Called the dampness.

Dampness is not a substance. It's not a materialized thing. It's a cheat.

It's energetic things. It's invisible things. Then the dampness.

This invisible cheat will sneak in your body. That stuff getting in. It's one of the modern disease.

It's like an ingredient. Now, once you have this ingredient. You can manifest so many different kind of conditions.

You can manifest. Just like conditions. You can manifest.

Use the dampness. Make so many very interesting conditions. You want the body get itchy.

You need a dampness. You want the chronic, you know, the blood infections. You need a dampness.

You need to lose hair. You need a dampness. There are so many things.

Condition or show. We say beautiful shows. You can use this good actors.

The dampness. The dampness is the best actor. They can change in many different ways.

The dampness can do. But in order. So here again.

In order dampness coming in to your body. Your body has to meet the requirement. Code.

You got it? That's the secret. That it is a secret. At that time, you know, master never tell this thing.

So that's why you have to figure out by yourself. So that's the secret. Unless you can ask it a question.

When did this come in? How do I prevent? I just prevent. You need immune system. You never prevent.

Immune system has nothing to do with this. All right? It's called a requirement. You meet the requirement.

Then they come in. You open the gate. They come in.

So avoid the code. You have to understand one more thing. They are.

I can say the 90% of disease. That's what we call the disease. The illness are all associated with the code.

Code is the one of the most nasty thing. Can cause cancer. 100% related to the code.

You never find the cancer related to the heat. It's a code. So that's why all the treatments, they are related to the heat.

Radiation, chemo, they all cause the body heat. It's a different kind of way. All right? Code is a very, very important thing.

Avoid. So the ancient people or Chinese, they figured out a lot of things. You know, don't do this.

Drink hot tea. Drink warm things. All right? So do not allow the body have a code.

So now you know. All right? This is just two of the major important ingredients for the stomach. Which means the requirement.

If you want your digestive system to be healthy. function at the highest level, at least the normal level. You have to avoid the two things.

One is code. Second is the damnness. Right? Code can be the temperature.

Right? Code can be essence. Essence always like a nature. Nature has a lot of essence.

Right? Essence is code. I'll give you another example called the essence can be called peppermint. Peppermint tea.

Peppermint tea. So when you drink peppermint tea, no matter how hot the water is, temperature is a high, it's a hot. Essence is a cold.

No, that's good. The yin and the yang. Right? The peppermint.

Temperature is a hot. Essence is a cold. So that's why if you have a sore throat, put it this way, then the peppermint tea might be very good because the peppermint tea, the cold part can deal the heat of your throat.

Right? You just have to know how to use this code. Essence. Right? You can turn it to hot no matter what you cook.

You never change. Essence. Now here, one of the most important things in the Chinese medicine is called essence.

Almost like a DNA. Essence never change. You should write down.

You should remember. You don't write down. I just want you to remember.

So after this all day, two days, when you walk out of here, what did you learn? You learn that essence never change. What does that mean? That means no matter what you did to me, I am still myself. Understand what I say? No matter what you do, you're still yourself.

You just become more profound. You never can change. Deep down, you never change.

But you just become more profound. You discover yourself more because in your meridians, never change. Right? So the essence is almost like each one, identity of the each planes, each elements, they never change.

Cool essence is cool essence. No matter what you do, cold is cold. No matter what you do, just like a ginger.

Ginger is a warm essence. It's warm. No matter what you do, ginger, you can put it in the, you know, grind it, put it in the ice cream of ginger ice cream.

Think of this. Temperature is cold. But the essence is still warm.

So it's perfect. Doesn't matter. So now you have a question.

You become confused. What makes you worry? I'm worried about the essence. I worry about the temperature.

I worry about visible. I worry about the invisible. Right? That's the question.

I know. The Russian mind always want to make a choice. Visible, invisible.

Invisible, invisible. I'm telling you, invisible, always more powerful than the visible. Please write down.

Invisible, always more powerful than the visible. Focus on the invisible. Essence, always more powerful than substance.

That's more powerful. That's what we need. So that's why among this cold, in the cold essence, you should pay attention.

Right? Pay attention, cold essence. Outside is so cold, weird, even no temperature change. Right? Look at that.

March, right? March or April, that time. Look like pretty warm. At that time, the essence hasn't completely changed yet.

So the March and the April, so many people easy catch a cold. Right? Immediately cold. Because why? They be foolish by the temperature.

Right? Invisible, always more powerful than the visible. Okay. Since I'm going to change different ways of teaching here.

So, if your stomach doesn't meet the requirement, how do we know? Right? Now you need to know. How do I know? How do I know my stomach screw up? How do I know I don't have a healthy digestive system? They got to be have a sentence. Right? We say body never lie.

How do we see the sentence? Where is the science? You need a science. Right? We need to see. We'll go to the one by one.

Right? Number one, tongue. Your tongue never lie. But as of today, a lot of people teach you brush your tongue.

Right? You can brush your tongue. So no matter how many times you brush, if they grow back to the white coating, then you know that's the signs of your body has a cold, also has a damage. Ooh, you got everything.

Do you have a good insurance? No, that's different. Right? Tongue. Number one is the tongue.

Everyone can see yourself. Everyone should see the healthy tongue. So if you wake up, even you don't need to brush your tongue, still look like a normal way, then it's good.

If you see the coating, white coating, white color, that means your digestive system has a cold. Thick white means then you have a damage. Right? Got it? That's very important, tongue.

Number two, hands and the feet cold. Right? You know, this and that concept when a lot of Western medicine, they don't put the disorder associated with the stomach. They give it a new, I forget what's the vocabulary they give it to it.

Right? That's right. But it's a stomach issue. Right? The hand and the feet cold.

So you shake your hand. Right? Or good morning, you shake your hand, cold hand, then you immediately know, uh-huh, the stomach. Right? No matter how many clothes they wear, the hand just cannot warm enough.

Right? Think of this concept. If a stomach at the center, in order the energy spread to the end of the, that's the last end. Right? Feet and the hand is end.

How much energy have to push too far? If the inside doesn't have enough energy, you cannot push too far. Right? It's so simple. It's energy.

You don't have energy. You look at the kids, children, young kid, you kind of wow. The hand is warm.

Right? Therefore, give you a different angle. If an older patient or serious illness patient, if their feet and the hand become so cold, it's not a good sign. Right? That means the digestive system almost shut down.

If a digestive system shut down, you can't process in the nutrition. It's very important. Because the stomach associated with the body muscles, so any kind of muscle issues associated with your stomach function disorder.

Right? I think this is a concept. Muscle. So if you're getting sagging, you're getting sagging there.

There. What is this? Stomach issue. Particularly here.

If you get a turkey neck, we call it a turkey neck. Yeah? That's a stomach issue. Because the stomach energy lines, it doesn't get it there.

So therefore, this part, you can't. You lose that. Because we say the Marines, we didn't get it.

So I think the Marines, I don't have to get it here. You guys can go to the Internet, find the path. It's easy to see.

So whatever these path lines, depending on which part of the path line, energy path lines are blocked. Just like a highway. Right? Depending on which part of the highway they start to do the construction, always cause the traffic jam.

But the real construction path is the real problem. But unfortunately, no one see that. Right? So you have to see that.

If here has the energy constructions, then energy doesn't go through that. Then here has muscle issues. Skin issues.

Right? All the muscle issue. So we have a chronic. If you feel your muscle don't have a strength, your muscle doesn't tight, your muscle too loose.

Right? That's stomach issue. Another issue. Any kind of digestive system issue.

Allergy. Food allergy. All the food allergy associated with the stomach.

Even though they are associated with a different kind of food, maybe nuts or seafood can be associated with other issues. But no matter what, they are still associated with the stomach. Stomach still is a part of the reasons because the food has to coming in.

Understand what I say? You're still responsible. If you're good, never happens. Let me put this one letter.

I hope you understand. We have so many organs. If a condition happens at the stomach digestive system, even though doesn't caused by digestive system, can be caused by kidney, can be caused by heart, but still stomach still are responsible because you take food.

Unless I take emotions. Understand what I say? What's called emotions? I get the bad news, I run into the bathroom. That's not a food.

It's emotions. It's directly coming into the body. So shut in a different system.

Doesn't go through the food. So if it goes through the food, the stomach is the first organ responsible. Understand what I say? Just like giving the other example here.

So you should learn these ways to help you to understand the relationship. Skin issue. We say all the skin issues are associated with the lung.

The lung is the organ responsible for all your beautiful skin. However, we have a skin issue. But the cause of the skin issue can be totally different.

Can cause by liver, can cause by kidney, can cause by other things. No matter what, still are related to lung. Lung still responsible because it shows on the skin.

Understand what I say? They still show on the skin. Otherwise, the issue wouldn't show on the skin. Would show on the inside of the organ different ways.

Just like there are no accidents. Depending on which the show, where you put this show and where. Right? Where you are, where you are.

See, I said where. Location, location, location. It's very important.

Right? We'll go back to beginning where I say there are no accidents. Every information, every event, every location has a purpose. There's always a purpose.

Right? We'll go back to the sentence. Again, I've gone too far. I have to pull it back.

Right? All the digestive system, all the tendons, the hand and the feet. Right? Worry. Your mind constantly worry.

Right? You say, I'm confused. I worry. Difficult to make the decision.

Right? There's emotions. Right? Right? And even sometimes as a sleeping insomnia. Insomnia also associated with a digestive system issue.

Right? Leukemia associated with a digestive issue. Stomach issue. Leukemia.

White blood cell issue. Right? So if a white blood cell issue, now here I'm going to lead you to the western way now. All the white blood cells based on the western medicine are associated with the immune system.

Right? How do we defend the immune system? High, low? So-so. But still, it's one part of the ingredients. They're always interesting to see the white blood cell.

Ideally, white blood cell control your white blood cell is the stomach and the spleen. They are controlled. They are the organ produce your white blood cell.

So if that's the way they are, the organ responsible for all your quality of your blood. Let me put it that way. The quality of your blood issue depend on quality of your digestive system.

What does that mean? That means if you say I have a high correction, who's responsible? What does high correction mean? Lousy blood. Put it that way. I'm going to say it that way.

Right? Who produce? How do they produce? Where they produce? See? So if you not produce good ones, so we go back to the stomach. If a stomach first organ, they don't produce good blood. How can liver processing distribute the good blood? Cannot.

You give me the lousy material, how can I do that? How can I change? You understand? So that's the issue. Any kind of blood. So that's why what you see, people go through the chemotherapy, radiation.

They kill what? Your red blood cell drop. White blood cell drop. Right? All of these things drop, drop, drop.

That means what? Now you know. Associated with your stomach function. Chemotherapies interrupt your digestive system.

Your body doesn't produce enough good quality blood. Very simple way to say it. So you have a sentence.

You understand that way. So that means all of these sentences will allow you to see. Right? Do you have a healthy digestive system or not? So you have one sentence, two sentences depending.

So all of these sentences can help you to give you information. However, sometimes same sentences are related to other organs. Right? Not just directly.

Sometimes other organs also can produce same kind of issues. Right? So today you just need to know that generally speaking, these things are associated. You always can say, hey, they always have issue.

No matter what, if you see this condition, they always have some degree put it this way, are related to digestive system function disorder. Right? After the digestive system, we're done. Then we go to the second one.

Go to the liver. Right? Liver. We say liver, liver, liver, liver.

Liver is so important. Why liver is so important? We say the liver is the spirit. Liver spirit can carry the spirit.

Right? How do we say it? Think of this. How do we know you still alive? Your spirit is still there. Think of this.

How do you know you have a spirit? How do we call someone have a spirit? Think of it. Oh, you don't have a spirit. Oh, that person is gone.

No spirit. Right? You go to hospital. If you see someone still lying there, you don't see spirit anymore.

Right? How do you see it? How does it look like? There's just a piece of meat lying there. No spirit. Eyes.

Right? We say eyes, the window of the spirit. If you have kids, grandchildren, look at their eyes. Innocent eyes.

That spirit is so shining. It's grown. It hasn't grown yet.

You can see. Try that. I would highly recommend everyone, if possible, go to look at the kids.

Right? Make sure the parents allow you to see. Otherwise, they call 911. They think there's something wrong with you.

I'm sorry. It's today so difficult. Right? Yeah.

We can get one, you know, here. You should see. See the children's eyes.

Also, see yourself. See yourself. You practice.

You change. Your eye change. The shape change doesn't matter.

They can come and go like a cloud. It doesn't matter. Eye change.

It's more important. Your spirit change. You should really look there, if possible.

Right? That's what you can identify yourself. Are you change or not? Right? So, even the eyes, in the Chinese medicine, we say the liver has opening window. It's eyes.

Every organ has opening way. Stomach opening is your lip. Then we go back to the, if you always lip dry.

Right? You see that the winter people, they do this lip dry. Why lip dry? The lip associate with the stomach and the spleen. The inside dry.

Inside the nutrition, the blood dry. So, that's why you try to do this, you know, what they call the, it's not the best. The best is the bacon.

Bacon, bacon, bacon, bacon. That's right. The best is the pork fat.

I'm sorry. It is. Pork fat is the best.

Yeah. If you can do the pork fat, it's highly recommended. Yeah.

It's the best. Maybe we'll do this. Maybe we'll give you a quick break first.

All right? Because the liver has a little bit of deep, you know, I want to explain the science. It's more exciting at the liver. I explain it actually more time.

Okay? Get a break.
