## How to use this file
1. Import the list into your transaction ledger or watchlist as "sell-targets" for alerts.
2. Pair targets with the playbook in `TIA 2026 Report - OUTLINE.md` (tiered selling: 30% at 65% of target, 30% at 75%, 30% at 85%, keep ~10%).
3. Add timestamp and source clip reference when you execute a trade (e.g., add transcript time snippet or page reference).

## Notes & caveats
- These targets were given in a spiritual/forecast context and are probabilistic. The author frequently emphasized timing uncertainty; use conservative risk management.
- Some tokens were listed with multiple differing targets in the transcript (short vs long term) — when in doubt treat the lower listed target as the nearer-term sell level and the higher as a long-term aspiration.
