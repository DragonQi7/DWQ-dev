- Mid-cycle sell target: ~$455,000 (approximate, watch for macro signals).
- Long-term target: ~$2,000,000 (multi-year / 7-year horizon per Annual Report).

- SUI — $18–$20 (strong upside thesis retained).
- TAO — $5,000–$6,000 (mid-target); long-term potential high (previously cited up to $50k in Annual Report context).
- ONDO — $3, then $6, then $12–$14.
- ICP — $60–$70 (Tia suggests $70 is an easy mid-point).
- RENDER — high-$50s, up to $75.
- SEI — $5s (Tia also mentions $7 as possible; 5–7 range recommended).

- GUNZ — $0.75, then $1.25 (expect rapid runs; patience needed).
- XPRT — $1.20 primary; possible higher targets later (high $2s or ~$9+ — treat as lottery ticket; check next month for hold confirmation).

## Action details & trade rules (practical)
1. Tiered exit plan: adopt a structure to take profits without trying to time absolute tops — e.g., sell 30% at 65% of target, 30% at 75% of target, 30% at 85% of target, keep ~10% for “just in case” upside.
2. Position sizing: limit microcap/lottery bets (e.g., XPRT, GUNZ) to small % of portfolio (1–3% each) to manage tail risk.
3. Liquidity caution: for low-liquidity tokens, stagger sells (use limit orders and smaller slices) to avoid slippage and market impact.
4. Documentation: update the transaction log with target, planned sell-tranche percentages, and exact limits to execute; include contingency: if price gap fills without completing orders, manually reassess.

Immediate checklist for the next 30 days
- Close margin/leverage; do not re-leverage positions until macro is stable.
- Export complete holdings and create the CSV transaction-log (use template in outline file).
- Prepare laddered limit sell orders for coins where targets are being approached — especially for large holdings in Stage-3 coins.
- Set DCA limit buys for BTC at $79k, $75k, $72k and smaller ladder orders for other core coins if desired.

## How to ingest into your watchlist / ledger
1. Convert this Markdown into a CSV: columns [ticker,near_target,mid_target,long_target,notes,priority].
2. Import into your exchange/watchlist or spreadsheet and attach a column `sell_plan` with the exact tiered limit order values you want to use.

## Notes & caveats
- Many targets were restated from the Annual Report — Report 49 emphasizes emotional effects and systemic risk but did not materially change many price targets.
- Keep a record of the transcript page/time where each target is mentioned for audit & provenance.
