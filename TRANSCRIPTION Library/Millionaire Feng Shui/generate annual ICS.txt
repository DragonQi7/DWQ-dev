I'll first add a todo to track this prompt-rewrite task (marking it in-progress), then produce the clear AI prompt you asked for. After producing the prompt I'll mark the todo completed.

Added 1 todo

Here is a clear, self-contained AI prompt you can use (or paste into another agent) to create the requested .ics events. It includes explicit assumptions and conflict-handling rules — edit the assumptions if your intent differs.

Prompt (for an AI that will produce a .ics calendar file)
---
Create an iCalendar (.ics) file for the year 2026 that adds all-day events for specific Chinese zodiac "day" and "month" matches according to the rules below. Use the VCALENDAR you were given as the baseline data source when available; otherwise compute day/month zodiac animals for 2026 using a standard sexagenary/zodiological library.

Requirements
1. Event creation rules
   - For every calendar DAY in 2026 whose Chinese zodiac animal is:
     - Rat → create an all-day event: Summary = "Nobleman Day — Monkey SW3"
     - Horse → create an all-day event: Summary = "Nobleman Day — Rat N2 (possible clash with Horse 2026)"
     - Rooster → create an all-day event: Summary = "Intelligence Day — Rooster W2"
     - Horse → create an all-day event: Summary = "Peach Blossom Day — Horse S2"
     - Pig → create an all-day event: Summary = "Sky Horse Day — Pig NW3"
   - For every calendar MONTH in 2026 whose Chinese zodiac animal is:
     - Rat → create an all-day event: Summary = "Nobleman Month — Monkey SW3"
     - Horse → create an all-day event: Summary = "Nobleman Month — Rat N2 (possible clash with Horse 2026)"
     - Rooster → create an all-day event: Summary = "Intelligence Month — Rooster W2"
     - Horse → create an all-day event: Summary = "Peach Blossom Month — Horse S2"
     - Pig → create an all-day event: Summary = "Sky Horse Month — Pig NW3"

2. Event fields & formatting
   - Use DTSTART;VALUE=DATE and DTEND;VALUE=DATE (DTEND is exclusive) so the event occupies that calendar day or whole month range.
   - DESCRIPTION must include:
     - The assigned sector/mountain code (e.g., "Monkey SW3") and a one-line human note such as "Generated from rule: days with Rat → Nobleman Day — Monkey SW3".
     - If a conflict occurs (see rule 4), add "CONFLICT: true" in the DESCRIPTION and briefly describe the clash.
   - Add an alarm (VALARM) to each event:
     - TRIGGER;VALUE=DATE-TIME set to 09:00:00Z on the day before DTSTART.
     - ACTION:DISPLAY and DESCRIPTION: "Reminder: <event summary> begins soon."
   - Generate a stable UID for each event (for example: uid-YYYYMMDD-<summary-hash>@generated).
   - Use PRODID: "-//Generated by AI//EN" and VERSION:2.0 in the VCALENDAR.

3. Month events: how to represent month ranges
   - For a month event, set DTSTART to the first calendar date of the month (e.g., 2026-03-01) and DTEND to the first calendar date of the following month (e.g., 2026-04-01), so the event covers the entire month.

4. Conflict handling (explicit rule)
   - If two different rules require creating events on the same date (a "clash"):
     - Create both events separately.
     - In the DESCRIPTION of each event, add a line: "CONFLICT: true — Other events on this date: <list of other event summaries>".
     - Also include an X-PRIORITY property (e.g., X-PRIORITY:5) so calendar apps can show priority. Do NOT drop any event automatically.
   - Note: the text you received mentioned "Rat N2 but clash w Horse 2026". Treat that as a potential conflict case per the above.

5. Time zones and alarms
   - Keep alarms in UTC using the trailing "Z" in the TRIGGER value; calendar apps will translate to local time on import.
   - Do not add floating time alarms — use VALUE=DATE-TIME with Z.

6. Validation & output
   - Validate the generated .ics for correct VCALENDAR format, matching BEGIN/END pairs, and that DTEND is strictly after DTSTART for every event.
   - Return a single .ics file content in plain text as the result (wrapped in code fences or as raw text depending on your interface). Also return a short JSON summary listing:
     - total events created
     - total day-events
     - total month-events
     - total conflicts found
     - example UID of one event

Assumptions & clarifying notes (adjust if different)
- "Days with Rat/Horse/rooster/pig" means days whose Chinese zodiac day stem-branch equals that animal (use a standard sexagenary-day calculation).
- "Months with Rat/Horse/rooster/pig" means months associated with those animals in the traditional zodiac-month mapping (use the same library or mapping you used for days).
- If you cannot compute zodiac animals, stop and request the exact mapping or the source calendar that lists animal for each date. Do not guess.
- If you prefer an alternate conflict resolution (e.g., prefer Nobleman over Peach Blossom), include an explicit rule and I will apply it.

Example event (all-day, with alarm) — for clarity
BEGIN:VEVENT
UID:uid-20260305-nobleman-monkey-sw3@generated
SUMMARY:Nobleman Day — Monkey SW3
DTSTART;VALUE=DATE:20260305
DTEND;VALUE=DATE:20260306
DESCRIPTION:Monkey SW3\nGenerated from rule: day=Rat → Nobleman Day — Monkey SW3\nCONFLICT: false
BEGIN:VALARM
TRIGGER;VALUE=DATE-TIME:20260304T090000Z
ACTION:DISPLAY
DESCRIPTION:Reminder: Nobleman Day — Monkey SW3 begins soon.
END:VALARM
END:VEVENT

Finish by producing the .ics file and the JSON summary.

If you'd like, I can now:
- Generate the .ics file using these rules for all of 2026 (I will need a method to compute zodiac animals for each day/month), or
- Produce the .ics only for the dates already present in your existing calendar file (merge mode), or
- Ask you for the exact mapping function/data you want me to use for zodiac calculation.

Which option do you want me to run next?
