## Understanding the Qimen Chart Structure (1:21:30 – 1:26:00)

The Qimen chart divides into eight palaces (directions: N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW).

Each palace contains four core components:

- Deity — the guardian frequency associated with the palace
- Star — the functional/action energy active in that palace
- Door — the manifestation gateway for specific outcomes
- Stem — the cosmic timing layer (time-coded influence)

Use these components together to identify which energy is active for a given palace at a given time.

## The Concept of “Doors” (1:26:00 – 1:30:20)

In Qimen the Door (門) is the manifestation gateway: each door specializes in a class of outcomes.

- **Open Door**: expansion, visibility, attraction
- **Rest Door**: healing, consolidation, pause
- **Life Door**: vitality, new opportunities, relationships
- **Scene Door**: fame, recognition, charisma
- **Death Door**: endings, release, transformation
- **Fear Door**: reflection, introspection, facing shadow
- **Harm Door**: caution — can bring conflict; learning through struggle
- **Delusion Door**: imagination, creativity, illusion

Note: each door can act positively or negatively depending on timing and context — “No door is bad — only misunderstood timing.”

## The Ten Guardians Overview (37:05 – 37:36)

It’s kind of like this—how many of you are familiar with Andrew Tate? Just look at his style: very direct, powerful, even a bit destructive. That’s the yang energy at work. For some people, that approach resonates.

If you have energies like Black Tortoise, Surging Snake, or especially Hulk, or even White Tiger, you tend to follow that strong, assertive, “macho” path.

But if your energy is different—say, Dying Heavens or Chief—you naturally lean toward love, joy, peace, and harmony. You aim to unite and balance rather than dominate.

Both approaches are expressions of emotional energy, just in different forms. That’s why I wanted to highlight this section under Alignment—to show the variety of energies and how they influence the way we manifest.


what to do in a haunted place
Perfect — here’s the **updated story version** of *“What to Do in a Haunted Place,”* now including your added lines (1:34:09–1:34:44) exactly where they belong in the flow:

---

I’ve traveled a lot and stayed in many hotels around the world. Most are perfectly fine—but every now and then, you walk into a place that feels… different. You can sense that something’s off, like the air itself carries a strange vibration. When that happens, you need to know how to energize yourself and take command of the space.

In **Qimen Dunjia**, there’s a very powerful saying:

> *“Gap means in emergency—follow the deities.
> Man means things that take time—use the door.”*

This phrase holds deep wisdom. It means that when you’re in an emergency or in an energetically charged situation, you should connect with the deities for protection and guidance.

Let me share a real experience. Around 2006 or 2007, I was in Singapore staying at a hotel near Raffles. It wasn’t the Raffles Hotel itself, but an older building next to it, the north wing before it was renovated. I was there in the late afternoon, waiting for a student to pick me up for dinner.

The room was old-fashioned—you had to twist the taps to get water. I was sitting, watching TV, when suddenly the tap turned on by itself. I turned it off, sat back down, and ten minutes later… it turned on again.

That’s when I knew something was present. The energy in the room was trying to make itself known.

My teacher once told me:

> *“If you ever find yourself in a haunted place—do not leave. If you run, your energy drops, and that’s when lower entities can attach to you.”*

So, I stayed. I grounded myself and spoke clearly to the space:

> “This is a human space. You may exist here, but you will not disturb me.”

Then, I used a Qimen technique called **backing the chief**. This aligns your energy and polarizes your field so that it becomes stable and strong. You’re declaring energetic authority over your environment.

Over time, I learned something even more powerful:

> You can **activate both the Nine Heavens and the Chief** together.
> Call upon them, **polarize your energy**, and **anoint the space** with a powerful force field of energy.
> When you do this, **lower-frequency energies cannot enter the space**.

With this technique, you can sleep soundly, completely undisturbed.

The process is simple:

1. **Back the Chief**—use the hourly chief if possible.
2. Or **align with Nine Heavens**.
3. **Polarize your energy** to strengthen your field.
4. If you can, **use fire energy**—it enhances the Chief’s earth energy and creates a balanced, protective shield.

In the end, I stayed in that room peacefully. The taps stopped turning on, the air settled, and the night was calm.

That’s the power of Qimen energy alignment—you don’t have to fear strange places. You just need to command your space, anchor your energy, and let the deities handle the rest.
