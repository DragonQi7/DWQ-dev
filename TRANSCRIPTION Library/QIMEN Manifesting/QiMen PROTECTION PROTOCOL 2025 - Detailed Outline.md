## Quick summary

This document is a detailed, action-oriented outline of the Protection Protocol taught in the live session saved at `QiMen PROTECTION PROTOCOL 2025 - 2025-11-03 12-03-11.txt`.

Purpose: provide a step-by-step checklist for running the formation, list activation windows/dates referenced in the lesson, and capture practical notes for repeat use and troubleshooting.

## Key components (concepts & energetic assets)
- Host chart: the instructor hosts an achievement chart; participants tune to the host's chart when they 'listen in' live.
- Sector/Focus: Southwest sector (primary focus for this protocol) — either face or back the Southwest.
- Palace focus: Soul palace (optional refinement) — use when you specifically suspect a soul-level contamination or hex.
- Stars & constellations used:
  - Level 5 chief (chief deity; growth/stability anchor)
  - Wing constellation (expands shield of light)
  - Destructor star (active breaker — breaks spells, returns negative energy)
  - Phoenix (red phoenix / fire imagery used for 'burning away' negative energy)

## Activation windows & dates found in the transcript
(verbatim references extracted from the session)

- Host activation hour (host's time): 9:00 a.m. — referred to as the "sneak hour" for the Protection protocol. (Instructor: "I'm going to host this at 9 a.m. the sneak hour…")
- Local replay window advised: participants on other time zones were told they could replay at their local 9:00–11:00 a.m. window to get an additional activation: "when your actual time comes in to 9, between 9 to 11am, you can actually listen to this again."
- Past cleansing referenced: "Remember cleansing on October 23rd? Did you guys use that…" — the instructor used the death door for that cleansing (death door = ending/clearing formation).
- Session recording / host timestamp: the transcript file name contains 2025-11-03; the session repeatedly refers to a 9am host activation and a replay opportunity at participant local 9–11am.

Notes on date interpretation: the lesson references specific past dates (e.g., Oct 23 cleansing) and host-hour activations (9am). Use the host-hour (9:00) and local 9–11am windows as the practical activation guidance. If exact calendar dates are required for future scheduling, select days when the same chart configuration appears (see Timing notes below).

## Step-by-step checklist (runnable)

Pre-flight
1. Confirm whether you will use the host chart (listen to the recorded session during the host's activation) or your own chart. If joining a hosted activation, tune to the host's time and follow the host instructions.
2. Identify the Southwest (SW) sector of your home or the SW area of your room. If you cannot reach SW physically, you may "back" the SW area by turning your chair so your back faces SW.
3. (Optional, advanced) Identify your personal Soul Palace on your QiMen natal/achievement chart; if you suspect soul-level contamination choose to back the SW while facing the Soul Palace direction (instructor used this refinement).

Protocol execution (short form)
1. Enter your SW zone and assume a seated posture (do not lie down).
2. If present in a live/hosted activation: prepare for a guided countdown (the instructor counted down from 8 to 0). If using the recording, align playback to the host's activation time (host 9:00). If replaying locally, use your local 9:00–11:00 a.m. window.
3. Breathe: slow, deep breaths. Use the breathing cues: breathe in to arrive / breathe to command / breathe to seal (3 intentional breaths were used at start).
4. Command structure (verbatim-style templates in transcript):
   - Call the Level 5 chief to form the dome of protection.
   - Call the Wing constellation to expand a shield of light.
   - Activate the Destructor star to ignite protecting fire; command negative energies to return to sender, purified.
   - Seal protection across four realms: spiritual, mental, emotional, physical.
5. Use visualization cues: luminous gold & silver dome; wing-feathers as radiant blades; destructor vortex of purifying fire; anchor the field at the heart center.
6. Close with gratitude and declaration phrases: e.g., "I am safe. I am secure. I am sovereign." and seal the formation.

Protocol execution (scriptable template)
1. Countdown 8→0 (arrive and center).
2. "I call upon the level 5 chief deity to activate all realms and celestial defense. I command the chief deity to connect with the wing constellation, extending its vast shield of light..."
3. Fill in your palace/name as needed, then command the destructor to return negative energy to sender, purified.
4. Seal: "I am safe. I am secure. I am sovereign. Protection is sealed across spirit, mind, heart, body. So it is commanded."

## Timing & repetition guidance
- Host-led activation: join at the host's stated time (9:00 a.m. host time on the session date). That yields the strongest 'one-to-many' effect.
- Local replay: participants were instructed they can replay at their local 9:00–11:00 a.m. window (the instructor said this yields a second cleansing/activation in the participant's timezone).
- Repeat cadence: if obstructions occur (internet dropouts, stronger hex), repeat the protocol on subsequent available host- or local-windows. Stronger conditions may require multiple repeats.
- Chart selection: the instructor emphasized the chart must show the correct formation for the protocol. If you are scheduling in advance, learn to select days/hours when the destructors, level 5 chief or similar alignments appear on your chart.

## Practical action items (short list with activation windows)
1. Immediate: Run the short protection script now using the SW/back-SW method (can be done anytime as a generic protection). (Activation window: any time; best when host chart or target chart is active)
2. Host replay: If you have the session recording, replay it at your local 9:00–11:00 a.m. on the date you choose to double the effect. (Activation window: local 9:00–11:00 a.m.)
3. House protection: perform the SW anchor in the home’s SW sector to extend the field to family/household. (Activation window: repeat daily until stabilized)
4. Soul-level clearance: if you suspect a targeted hex, combine SW placement + facing your Soul Palace and run the full destructor + seal sequence. (Activation window: aim for host chart hour or days with strong destructor alignments)

## Troubleshooting & notes
- Obstructions: if the signal is blocked, repeat the protocol; obstructions often indicate stronger negative signatures requiring repeated action.
- Safety: the instructor frames "send back with interest" as returning energy, not harming physical people. Use ethical intent and safety language if you craft your own commands.
- Record keeping: note the date/time you ran the activation and any subjective effects (energy lifted, dreams, mood changes). This helps determine repeat cadence.

## Suggested deliverables to add (next steps)
- A one‑page, printable "Protection Protocol" cheat‑sheet (short script + SW/back-SW diagram + quick troubleshooting). Suggested filename: `TRANSCRIPTION Library/QIMEN Manifesting/cheatsheets/QiMen - Protection - Quick Card.md`.
- A short MP3 export of the protection guidance aligned to a 9:00 host start time for participants to replay in their local window.
