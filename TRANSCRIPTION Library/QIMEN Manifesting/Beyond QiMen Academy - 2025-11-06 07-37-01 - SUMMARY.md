### One-line summary
Instructor introduces the Qimen Mastery Circle (a recurring/perpetual advanced learning club), shares a personal origin story about momentum vs goals, and demonstrates "Warcraft" (an hour-chart Qimen method) for strategic, actionable forecasting and business/consulting tactics—applied live to attendee cases (boss favoritism, competitor undercutting, new realtor, post-COVID recovery).

### Session flow
- Personal story & origin of Mastery Circle: momentum, learning over finishing a single goal.
- What the Qimen Mastery Circle offers: monthly premium lessons, exclusive cliff notes, planners, voice guides, and community support; past topics are not reissued to new joiners.
- Introduction to Warcraft: an hour-chart Qimen plotting technique that yields layered actionable advice (tactics / stratagems / divine counsel).
- Live case coaching examples: boss favoritism, competitor copying/undercutting, new realtor strategy, and post-COVID business recovery.
- Logistics and enrollment notes (pricing/top‑up options, upcoming events).

### Key concepts & takeaways
- The dream is momentum — ongoing practice and community sustain mastery.
- Warcraft is a strategic Qimen application (an active 'Art of War') that prescribes when, where, and how to act: map decision-makers, pick battlefields, prepare alliances, time opening moves to hinge events, sequence follow-ups, consolidate, then withdraw.
- Timing windows are essential: examples called out include ~3 months (promotion cycle) and ~7 weeks (bait/competitive window).

### Detailed Warcraft mechanics (practical)
Warcraft uses the hour chart to produce three layers of guidance:

1. Tactics (what to do now)
	 - Immediate, concrete actions (public deliverables, alliances, timing of announcements).
	 - Examples: present an executive brief, publish a public deliverable, or stage a targeted micro-campaign.

2. Stratagems (how to sequence & position)
	 - Medium-term sequencing and deception/feints (camouflage products, staged openings, bait & trap tactics).
	 - Examples: "save the near, forget the far" (fight close to trade certainty for control), divide rounds, exploit small disruptions.

3. Divine Counsel (longer-term alignment & timing)
	 - Which hinge events to use (promotion cycles, leadership vacuums, performance reviews) and when to withdraw/heal.
	 - Examples: align opening move to a promotion cycle (~3 months), consolidate and withdraw immediately after the win.

Practical plotting note: Warcraft is hour-chart based — when preparing an action plan, plot the hour chart for the relevant decision moment (e.g., promotion panel hour, performance review hour) and use the chart to pick the dominant tactical box.

### Practical playbooks (step‑by‑step)

1) Boss favoritism — engagement playbook (3‑month plan)
- Goal: shift decision criteria so promotion/assignment favours you.
- Timeline: begin 3 months before the promotion/review date.
- Steps:
	1. Map stakeholders: list decision-makers, influencers, and their incentives (1 week).
	2. Gather measurable wins: collect KPIs, project outcomes, testimonials, and peer endorsements (weeks 1–4).
	3. Produce a public deliverable: executive brief or deliverable timed to appear before the decision window (weeks 6–8).
	4. Build alliances: secure visible endorsements and peer sponsors; prepare contingency legal/HR advice (weeks 4–8).
	5. Control narrative: craft messages that reframe the issue to your moral high ground; prepare public/departmental communication (week 8).
	6. Execute: present deliverable shortly before the promotion decision, follow up with endorsements and documented wins (decision week).
	7. Consolidate & withdraw: secure a temporary mandate or budget, institutionalize wins, then reduce exposure and repair internal relationships (post-decision 1–4 weeks).

Key documents to prepare: Executive Brief (1‑page), Evidence Dossier (KPIs + dates), Peer Endorsement Templates (email/Slack snippets), Timeline Gantt (3 months).

Risks & mitigations:
- Risk: escalation backfires — mitigate with legal/HR review and a rollback plan.
- Risk: reputation damage — ensure messaging emphasizes outcomes and public-good framing.

2) Competitor copying — bait & reclaim playbook (7‑week window)
- Goal: expose copying, reclaim customers, damage competitor's legitimacy.
- Timeline: deploy over a 7‑week window from bait release to public disclosure.
- Steps:
	1. Prepare a camouflage product (a deliberately flawed or simplified offering) and a launch story that will attract copycats (week 0).
	2. Launch publicly in a way that is visible to competitors (socials, niche forums) and track uptake (week 0–2).
	3. Monitor for copying: collect evidence (screenshots, dates, product specs) and preserve timestamps (week 2–4).
	4. Prepare evidence dossier: side-by-side comparisons, customer testimonials, serial numbers, screenshots (week 4–5).
	5. Public disclosure strategy: release a limited, fact-based disclosure showing the copied product is flawed and offer free remedy/upgrades to affected customers (week 6).
	6. Offer conversion pathway: a clear, lower-friction path for affected customers to switch to your authentic product (special offer, fast onboarding) (week 6–7).
	7. Follow-up: secure testimonials and legal/PR action if needed; institutionalize customer care to retain conversions.

Legal & ethical notes: Document everything; consult legal counsel before public accusations; prefer fact-based disclosures rather than inflammatory language.

3) New realtor / small business — underdog positioning checklist (8‑week runway)
- Goal: win micro‑segments and dissatisfied clients.
- Steps:
	1. Map micro‑segments: identify niche customer profiles neglected by big players (week 1).
	2. Create partner bundles: list potential partners (loan officers, Feng Shui practitioners, home stagers) and craft a simple bundle offering (week 1–2).
	3. Daily micro-content sprint: produce 2–3 short videos/posts per week for 8 weeks demonstrating practical tips and client stories (weeks 1–8).
	4. Offer high‑value, low‑cost trials (free consult, mini-audit) to capture dissatisfied customers (weeks 2–6).
	5. Sign long-term support agreements where possible (maintenance/concierge packages) to lock revenue (weeks 4–8).
	6. Measure: track lead conversion rate, cost per acquisition, and churn.

4) Post‑COVID recovery — partner acceleration & speed play
- Goal: stabilize revenue quickly by bundling partner services and moving with urgency.
- Steps:
	1. Identify 2–3 complementary partners and draft a co-branded offer (week 1).
	2. Launch a short, urgent campaign (7–14 days) with a clear CTA and limited-time onboarding bonus (week 1–2).
	3. Run short daily content pieces to create urgency and maintain visibility (week 1–4).
	4. Use fast feedback loops: daily metrics review and immediate iteration.

### Templates & snippets (copy/paste)
- Executive Brief (1‑page) — headings: Situation, Objective, Evidence (3 bullets), Proposed Action, Request (endorsement/resource).
- Peer Endorsement email snippet:
	"Hi [Name], can I ask for a quick 2‑line endorsement on [project]? It would help in [promotion/client pitch]. Thanks — [Your Name]"
- Public disclosure snippet (competitor copy):
	"We discovered an unauthorized copy of our [product]. Evidence is attached; if you bought [X], here's our recommended fix and how we can help you migrate."

### Sample timelines (compact)
- Boss engagement: Week 0 = stakeholder mapping; Weeks 1–4 = evidence gathering; Weeks 5–8 = prepare deliverable & endorsements; Decision at Week 12.
- Competitor bait: Week 0 = bait launch; Weeks 1–3 = monitor; Week 4–5 = evidence assemble; Week 6 = public disclosure; Week 7 = conversion push.

### Measurement & success criteria
- Boss play: promotion/role change OR measurable policy change, plus endorsement count >= 3, executive brief accepted.
- Competitor play: percent of competitor's customers converted, public correction/acknowledgment, reduction in competitor visibility.
- Small business: CAC (cost per conversion) under target, 20% month-over-month lead growth, and 60% retention of converted customers after 3 months.

### Risks, ethics & practitioner cautions
- Warcraft tactics can be aggressive. Respect legal/ethical boundaries. Avoid defamation and unverified public claims.
- Always have a rollback plan: if a public move backfires, prioritize relationship repair and damage control.
- Be mindful of reputation and long-term trust — sometimes slow, steady positioning beats short-term aggressive wins.

### Tools & resources (practical)
- Chart plotting: use the Qimen plotter tools you already have; if plotting manually, ensure hour-chart timestamps and timezones are correct.
- Documentation & evidence: timestamped screenshots, Wayback Machine captures, Google Drive/Dropbox with immutable timestamps.
- PR/legal: have a simple legal checklist and a trusted lawyer/HR contact for escalation.
- Content tools: short video recorder (phone), Loom, Canva for quick visuals, Hootsuite or Buffer for scheduling.

If you'd like, I can now:
- produce the one‑page "Warcraft cheat sheet" as a downloadable Markdown or PDF; or
- create four separate short checklists (Boss / Competitor / Realtor / Recovery) each as a standalone MD file you can use with clients.
