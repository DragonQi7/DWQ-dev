Welcome to the Cheeman Manifesting Framework.

Okay. Now, some of you when it comes to manifesting, you guys are already some seasoned practitioners on your own, right?

You've done different types of manifesting.

Well, the biggest difference is we are doing Cheeman manifesting.

And and it focuses on the usage of time dimensional energies to assist you in that manifesting process.

If you have been having on and off successes, if you've been doing manifesting on your own for some time, sometimes it will sometimes doesn't work.

So the manifesting part, okay?

Qimen Dunjia is the ability to manifest and bend reality.

Or you can use manifesting techniques to co-create the reality that you want.

And the second thing that could be stopping you from manifesting or getting the outcome that you want to truly change your life, right?

Clarity is a key. When you have clarity, a lot of these blockages to manifest will just dissipate.

Now, before we could do that, the first thing we need to address is manifesting.

You first need to know that people cannot get what they want because they confuse manifesting with wishing.

So instead of wishing, you're going to manifest to become.

And you need to identify which of this category you kind of fall into because each one will have a different solution when they are doing the achievement manifesting, okay?

They are unconsciously manifesting things they don't want.

The things that you hate most comes through for you because you're unconsciously manifesting that outcome.

The Qiman manifesting framework is the exact steps that you'll be learning in this four-part training to consciously manifest the outcome or the reality that you want.

When all four realms are aligned, all manifestations become reality.

So to co-create destiny, while you could use certain dates and time to manifest outcomes, but before you manifest, you have to do one type of exercise, and that is cleansing.

Cleansing first, manifesting later.

When you beg, desperation does not manifest, remember that.

You may actually think that, you know, we're either manifesting or we're not manifesting, right?

As long as I don't think about manifesting, I'm not manifesting anything in my life.

It's not true. Everyone manifests.

This is a framework that if you follow the framework, you will notice that it can 10x your previous efforts in manifesting.

If you know the time, you superimpose it, you might not know how to manifest exactly in the beautiful words that other people know, but you definitely can find the right portal and the energy resides and all you need to say is a few keywords and you open up the outcome, the possibility.

And when you clear this, when you finally clear out the energy, that is when the subsequent part where you install the new intentions and the commands, that's when you will get the true essence of manifesting.

This is called the Divine Manifesting Clarity and Intention Activation Challenge.
