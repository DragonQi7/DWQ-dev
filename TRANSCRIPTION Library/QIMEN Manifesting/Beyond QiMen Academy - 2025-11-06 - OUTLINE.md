## 3. Key concepts & definitions
- Warcraft: an hour-chart plotting method that maps tactical boxes to practical stratagems. Use hour charts for moment-of-action timing.
- Tactics: immediate, concrete actions to execute now.
- Stratagems: medium-term sequencing, deception, and battle-level positioning.
- Divine Counsel: long-term timing and hinge-event identification (when to open, when to withdraw).
- Save the Near, Forget the Far: fight in proximity to secure certainty rather than risk a large-scale fight.

## 4. Warcraft mechanics — how to use (practical)
Follow this mini-contract before using Warcraft on a client problem:

- Inputs: client DOB/year (for self palaces), event date (promotion, review), the question (clear business objective), and the hour-chart of the hinge moment.
- Outputs: a 3-layer action plan (immediate tactic, 4–8 week stratagem sequence, hinge-event timing and withdraw consolidation plan).
- Success criteria: measurable change within the timing window (promotion, client wins, conversions) or tactical milestone reached.

### Step-by-step to produce a Warcraft plan (practical):
1. Define the objective in one sentence (e.g., secure promotion within next review cycle).
2. Identify the hinge event (date/time): promotion review, leadership meeting, contract renewal.
3. Plot the hour-chart for that hinge event (local timezone). Note which palaces are dominant (career, reputation, alliances).
4. Read the tactical box: extract the three-layer advice (tactics/stratagems/divine counsel).
5. Translate each layer into calendarized tasks (week/day schedule), assign owners and deliverables.
6. Prepare evidence & communication templates (executive brief, endorsement emails, public deliverable).
7. Execute with daily/weekly measurement and a rollback plan.

### Practical plotting tips
- Use consistent timezone normalization (convert client times to local office zone).
- When uncertain, prefer smaller, safer opening moves first (pilot deliverable) to test response.
- Always capture immutable timestamps (screenshots, uploaded documents with server timestamps) when planning public disclosures.

## 5. Playbooks (step-by-step)
