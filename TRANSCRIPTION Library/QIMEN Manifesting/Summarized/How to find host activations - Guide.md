This short guide collects the speaker's practical instructions for locating future host activation windows (day/hour charts), with key quotes, a 5-step checklist, and recommended resources.

## Key transcript guidance (short quotes)
- "Qimen technique: always use the 'now' charts (day chart/hour chart). The method: have the future define the present and the present rewrite the past." — (Day/hour chart guidance)
- "Use day chart for general timing; hour chart for faster/precise activations." — (Timing hierarchy)
- "Overlay your destiny palace with the day chart — if a high-level chief enters your target palace, it's an excellent day to command that subject." — (Portal overlay rule)
- "There are a couple of ways you could get the portal charts for the month, the day, the hour charts… go to the main plotter page without even logging in. If you want to prepare in advance... get a copy of the Tongshu." — (Tools & planning)
- "Portal rule: pick the star/door/constellation that matches the life area (palace) you want to affect; use day or hour charts (hour = faster, more precise)." — (Selection heuristic)

## Short practical checklist (5 steps)
1. Clarify your target palace (what life area you want to affect: wealth, health, relationships, career, soul palace, etc.).
2. Decide scale & precision: use Day chart for general power/longer outcomes; use Hour chart when you need fast, precise windows.
3. Get the charts:
   - Quick: use the public Qimen plotter/plotting page for the current day/hour (no login required).
   - Plan-ahead: use an annual almanac (Tongshu) or the instructor's manifesting calendar to precompute promising dates.
4. Overlay & scan: overlay the Day/Hour chart onto your natal/destiny palace and look for desirable overlaps (chiefs, destructor, void, wing constellation, etc.). If a high-level chief or the protocol star appears in your target palace, mark that day/hour as a candidate.
5. Pick the portal & run the protocol: confirm the star + constellation + door match your intended protocol (e.g., destructor for protection, void/death for clearing). Run on the Day or Hour window you found; repeat if obstructions occur.

## Quick heuristics & tips
- Beginners: start with Day-chart activations (simpler, more forgiving). Advanced: use Hour charts for surgical activations.
- If you rely on a host: align to the host's stated activation hour; otherwise replay at your local 9:00–11:00 a.m. window (speaker's instruction for protection sessions).
- If planning in advance: use the Tongshu/almanac to shortlist candidate days, then verify hour-level portals with the plotter.
- Keep a simple log: date, chart used (day/hour), palace targeted, star/door used, subjective result — helps tune repeat cadence.

## Recommended resources
- Qimen plotter / manifesting calendar (instructor site) — for live day/hour charts and portal plotting.
- Tongshu / Almanac — pre-mapped daily portals for planning.
- Your QiMen natal/destiny chart (baseline) — overlay with day/hour charts.

## Example workflow (5 minutes)
1. Open plotter and enter the date you want to check.
2. Note which stars/doors occupy the palace you will target.
3. If a desirable star (chief/destructor/void/wing) is present, pick that day; otherwise scan adjacent days/hours.
4. If you need more precision, inspect the hour-chart for the chosen day and pick an hour when the portal aligns.
5. Schedule the activation and run the protocol in the chosen window.
