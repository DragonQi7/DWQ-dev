## The eight levels (quick map)
- Level 1 — Survival: inner safety, basic stability. Default drift: fear. Training: trust and steadying routines.
- Level 2 — Desire: wanting, appetite, attraction. Default drift: chronic “someday.” Training: choose + equivalent exchange.
- Level 3 — Power: leadership, agency, conquering. Default drift: control/ego. Training: disciplined, ethical direction.
- Level 4 — Connection: love, relating, harmony. Default drift: people-pleasing or isolation. Training: honest boundarying + rapport.
- Level 5 — Growth: self-development, fulfillment. Default drift: stagnation/busywork. Training: skill upgrades + stretch cycles.
- Level 6 — Intuition: inner knowing, signal selection. Default drift: over-analysis paralysis. Training: quiet mind, better questions.
- Level 7 — Soul: transcendence, purpose, meaning. Default drift: bypass/over-detachment. Training: embodied service + pruning.
- Level 0 — Tao: nothing/everything; non-dual unity. Practice: presence, non-forcing, right timing.

## How they appear in your chart

QiMen charts encode the levels as dot-counts on sector edges. Convention used in your materials:
- 1 dot → Level 1 (Survival)
- 2 dots → Level 2 (Desire)
- 3 dots → Level 3 (Power)
- 4 dots → Level 4 (Connection)
- 5 dots → Level 5 (Growth)
- 6 dots → Level 6 (Intuition)
- 7 dots → Level 7 (Soul)
- 0 (circle/none) → Level 0 (Tao)

Where to look:
- Destiny chart: shows your native alignments per palace (your “always-on” baseline).
- Day/Hour charts: when a chart overlays a palace, the visiting formation can temporarily light up that level. Those are prime activation windows.

Reading rule-of-thumb:
- When a task matches a level’s function, perform it when that level is active in the relevant palace.
  - E.g., need courage/action in Career? Use a Level-3 (Power) window hitting your Career/Authority palace.
  - Need clarity? Favor a Level-6 (Intuition) window that overlays your Soul or Problem palace with supportive stars/doors.

## Four-realm backdrop (why timing matters)
- Universe/Spirit (deities) → inspiration
- Heaven (stars) → thoughts/quality of mind
- Earth (doors) → actionable pathways
- Human/Man (stems) → experienced results

Align intent across all four realms + the appropriate level and outcomes arrive faster (your transcript repeats this principle).

## Practical meanings, distortions, and upgrades

### Level 1 — Survival
- Means: Safety, body, breath, baseline stability; “am I okay?”
- Distortion: Chronic fear/safety-seeking, reactive decisions.
- Upgrade: Daily steadiness rituals, small wins, breath anchoring; pick low-risk actions to rebuild trust.
- Best use: Stabilize health/finances; start recovery; begin any transformation here if shaky.

### Level 2 — Desire
- Means: Wanting, attraction, appetite for change.
- Distortion: Endless “someday,” external validation dependency.
- Upgrade: Convert wants → chosen outcomes with specific exchange (time, energy, money). Make it within realm of possibility.
- Best use: Declare specifics; write numbers; attach exchange; take first tangible step.

### Level 3 — Power
- Means: Agency, direction, conquest, leadership.
- Distortion: Force/control, ego battles; burnout.
- Upgrade: Ethical direction, harm-door discipline (external work, training, price-paid instead of regret).
- Best use: Launches, negotiations, decisive moves; physical discipline blocks.

### Level 4 — Connection
- Means: Relating, harmony, rapport, visibility.
- Distortion: People-pleasing or withdrawal.
- Upgrade: Speak truth with clear boundaries; use Six Harmony style openings, agreements, social proof.
- Best use: Partnerships, audience-building, reconciliation, contracts.

### Level 5 — Growth
- Means: Fulfillment via progress; capability-building.
- Distortion: “Busy” with no skill gain; plateau.
- Upgrade: Train, iterate, measure; Level-5 Chief windows are ideal for self-improvement and protection protocols.
- Best use: Courses, certifications, system upgrades; rehab and strength cycles.

### Level 6 — Intuition
- Means: Inner knowing; filter signal from noise.
- Distortion: Over-analysis and fear-induced “knowledge.”
- Upgrade: Ask one clear question; quiet mind; watch evidential signs tied to that question.
- Best use: Choice clarity, creative direction, risk sensing, oracle work.

### Level 7 — Soul
- Means: Transcendence/purpose; meaning-driven edits to life.
- Distortion: Spiritual bypass; floating above responsibilities.
- Upgrade: Purpose + embodiment; end what must end (“death door” for closures), serve something bigger.
- Best use: Career pivots, vows, legacy moves, endings/beginnings.

### Level 0 — Tao
- Means: Non-dual unity; do-by-non-doing; perfect timing.
- Practice: Presence, stillness, allow pure intelligence to move; act only when it’s obviously time.
- Best use: High-leverage “one move” moments; retreats; simplifying.

## Fast protocol: matching problem → level
- Anxiety/fear spike → Level 1. Stabilize first.
- Stuck in wanting → Level 2. Choose + exchange.
- Need decisive action → Level 3. Train/execute.
- Relationship/audience issue → Level 4. Converse/collab.
- Plateaued skills → Level 5. Study/rep/measure.
- Clarity fog → Level 6. Ask one question; observe signs.
- Misaligned life path → Level 7. Purposeful pruning.
- Over-efforting → Level 0. Pause, presence, one precise move.

## Chart-usage checklist
1) Identify the life area/palace you’ll affect (career, wealth, health, relationships, soul, etc.).
2) Determine the level your situation calls for (table above).
3) Scan Day/Hour charts for that level entering your target palace with supportive formations (deity/star/door).
4) Back-to or sit-in the target direction; state the command across four realms; include equivalent exchange and a physical step.

Command template:
> I command the [deity/star/constellation] to move through spirit, heaven, earth, and human realms to [specific outcome for palace/area]. I anchor this with [your exchange/action]. So it is commanded; so it is done.

## Example mappings (illustrative)
- Close a deal this week → Level 3 + Level 4 window overlaying Wealth/Career palaces; command + outreach call list; show up on the chosen hour.
- Get clarity on two options → Level 6 in Soul/Problem palace; one-question ask; journal dreams/signs for 7 days; decide on day 7.
- End an unhelpful pattern → Level 7 with Death Door present; command closure; remove triggers; install a new ritual.
