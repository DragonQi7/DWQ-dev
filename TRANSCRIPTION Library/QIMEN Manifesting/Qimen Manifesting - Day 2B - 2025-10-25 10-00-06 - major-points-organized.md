## Overview: day chart, doors & actions

> "These are all the eight doors. Every day is a different position. So these govern actions."

> "We superimpose the eight doors over our natal charts... we just have to look at what goes into certain sectors like our destiny palace, and or maybe our karmic palace, and or certain other palaces like wealth and career..."

> "Depending on which of these doors that you will be using... these eight doors will be in a different position... they obviously will be with different deities, different stars, and different stems at the same time. That gives it its different flavor."

## Eight doors — quick keywords (verbatim highlights)

Open Door

> "Open door is great for rebirth, growth, opportunities, and new beginnings."

> "Open door can only 10x something when you're actually having an actual plan... otherwise you 10x the old problem."

Rest Door

> "Rest door is great for... resting, rejuvenation, enabling help because resting means easy. Easy means someone is helping you... great for healing." 

Life Door

> "Live door is great for profits... developing something... advancement... betterment... business activity is life door."

Scenery Door

> "Scenery dorm... to enhance... beautifying... reputation, status, credibility... promotes success, it speeds things up." 

Delusion Door

> "Delusion door... blockages only applies to forecasting, it does not apply to manifesting... it's the door of protection... sacred spaces are created by door of delusion." 

Harm Door

> "Harm door relates to the ability to conquer pain... pain of discipline, better than pain of regret... door of training... overcome obstacles and hardships." 

Fear Door

Death Door

> "Death door means end of the road... time to let go... detachment is door of death... great to give up something to move on to the next." 

## Using doors with natal/dynamic charts

> "Look at which door has entered your destiny sector... if death door entered your career palace... it means today what you want to manifest has to be related to letting go of something in order to succeed in your career."

> "We use the day chart / hour chart (the 'now') to align actions: the future defines the present and the present rewrites the past."

## Homework, book giveaway & next steps

> "This book contains all the information related to a door in Qimen Dunjia... I'll select three winners from those who've done the homework."

> "Download the document, do the homework, submit it to the Facebook group. We'll select winners and provide feedback." 

## Recap: three step alignment method

> "Three techniques: (1) fix low energy / Qi, (2) cut invisible chains (use White Tiger / Hulk energy to cut and replace), (3) use the door that sits in the palace (destiny/karmic/career) to determine the right action type."

> "If you rewire your energy and use the right doors at the right time, you can manifest the positive outcome. Part three will be on writing the perfect command." 

## Q&A highlights (verbatim responses)

> "Q: Do I need Chinese or metaphysics background? — 'I had zero background... everything was broken down into practical steps... you can start applying right away.' — Erin Palmer."

> "Q: Is it too time-consuming if I run a busy business? — 'I started small, just pulling a chart before making one or two key decisions. It takes a few minutes, not hours.' — Chua LP."
