## Opening & personal Qimen stories

> "Welcome to my lecture..."

> "To be honest, my first journey with Qimen is because I followed Jato quite early... 2015 I took his getting whatever you want class... 2017 the year where he first launched Thrive, I also decided to take out Qimen Mastery."

> "Prior to attending the actual Qimen forecasting class, just with the books alone, I helped my friend diagnose his illness problem... his left ear lost the hearing... wisdom tooth growth pressing on nerve... after acupuncture, hearing begins."

> "I believe that using Qimen is actually there for helping people to make the decisions..."

> Testimonial from Patricia: invoking the chief/backing to the nobility direction produced rapid help (tow truck, loaner car, hot coffee) when stranded on the road.

## Course logistics & structure

> "We are learning a whole subject called Qimen Manifesting... there are four parts to this training. We've done part one (the awakening). Today is part two: divine guidance and alignment."

> "Part three will be the perfect command... part four will allow you to master the game."

> "If you missed the telegram cleansing or recap videos, you can backtrack later; materials are sent by email (check spam)."

## One-match metaphor: small shifts

> "It only takes one match to start a fire... sometimes all it takes is one small shift to transform your life."

> Exercise: move one match to make the equation correct — metaphor: one tiny change can 10x outcomes.

## Attitude: mediocrity vs conviction

> "How many of you have gotten used to mediocrity? ... being average or below average is normalized for many."

> "If your life is full of complaints, you're also manifesting a lot of things that you're complaining about."

> "The right action is not always about adding stuff... it's about realigning stuff. Whatever you need to succeed, you are already born with — it's a question of shifting one thing, maybe two at most." 

## Cleansing / detoxing & energy hygiene

> "Elimination of the toxics... your spiritual energy, your mind, your heart — sometimes it's the main cause for not manifesting the things that you want."

> "You cannot over-detox — overdoing anything is not good — but many people need repeated cleansing."

## Three groups: low-energy, invisible chains, clueless

> "There are three groups of people: (1) Low-energy people (no courage), (2) People with self-imposed beliefs / invisible chains, (3) People who are clueless (don't know what to do)."

> Low energy: "Lack of courage, easily overcome by fear, easily distracted; requires courage to present, ask for what you deserve, give value." 

> Invisible chains: "Self-imposed beliefs subconscious — the invisible chains that hold you down... manifests as blocks to windfalls, relationships, careers."

> Clueless: "Don't know what to do; need to learn the right actions (daily doors) — clarity and patience required." 

## Manifesting framework (inner core → activation → reality-bending → master)

> "Five stages in mastering Qi Men: inner core (what's inside you), activate your spiritual power, reality bending (turning invisible to visible), master the game (conquer battles), and sage's command (right instructions)."

> "Activate the ability (foresight/business acumen) — use it repeatedly; reality-bending is the ability to take ideas and make them real." 

## Qi levels, broadcast, and alignment checklist

> "Qi is the foundation of all manifesting. Your Qi determines whether your broadcast is strong, weak, clear, or distorted."

> High-Qi: "vital, radiant, magnetic — manifestations arrive with clarity and synchronicity."

> Low-Qi: "depleted due to overthinking, anxiety, stress, unresolved emotions — yields static/confused reception and inconsistent manifesting." 

> Practical: use the provided practice sheet / treatment check-in daily to self-assess whether you are on high or low end of the spectrum.

## Invisible chains, karmic palace & destiny palace technique

> "Invisible chains are attachments that behave like an 'invisible rope' — you must untie them (the camel story)."

> Qimen technique: always use the 'now' charts (day chart/hour chart). The method: have the future define the present and the present rewrite the past.

> Two palaces to use:

- Destiny palace (Qimen destiny palace) — backing this direction lets the future self define present actions; use it to 10x future outcomes.
- Karmic palace — backing this direction lets you rewrite/reframe the past (remove negative meaning) to release invisible chains.

> "To break generational/strong chains, watch for overlap days when powerful energies (White Tiger / Hulk) enter your karmic palace — use those days to give a command, cut the cord, and replace the old narrative." 

## Practical notes & next steps

> "Manifesting requires clarity: write down what you really want, why it's worth it, and the cause of inaction (COI). Anchor intent with emotion (gratitude, music, movement) so that the command broadcasts the right vibrational energy."

> "Commands: part three will teach constructing the right instruction to direct divine energy — you must practice commands, timing, and aligning your body to act when the signal arrives."

> Protection & force fields: brief notes on backing the hourly chief and using fire element (incense/candle) to polarize your field when staying in low-energy/haunted places — practical protection techniques will be offered in future training if there's interest.
