Guys, bring up the chat please. You guys all ready? Yeah. You see the chat? Yeah, I see it.

Nice. All right, guys, before we start, please tell me where you are from. Is this your first time joining a JoYup event? Go ahead and type in the chat right now. 

Nice. Okay, I see some familiar names here. James, Yixuan. 

Okay. All right, Sandra. Cool. 

All right. So now we have also the telegram just in case you are new. Sometimes it's easier to look at the chats on the telegram site. 

So if you will post, if you need to let us know anything, just put us on the telegram channels, okay? Or you can also post it here. All right, type a 1 if you guys are ready. Okay, type a 1. Nice. 

Okay. You cannot hear my voice. Listen, guys, if there's any technical related stuff, it's better you try and sort it out on your side because our lines, guys, our lines are okay, right? Yeah, all good. 

Yeah. So our lines are okay. And if you guys are, if you can help out my team, that'll be nice. 

That'll be appreciated. If you can just also text them and tell them that you guys are hearing me all right. Because some people, it's their own microphones, their own settings that's the problem. 

So I don't want my team to keep having to reply on tech related stuff because I want to have like focus like this two hours or so on giving you the best training ever. How's that? Okay. So you're going to help each other out by typing and telling them, right? Okay. 

You guys all good? Okay. So if you're ready, let's begin. Welcome to the Cheeman Manifesting Framework. 

There's going to be a four-part training on mastering the art of Cheeman Manifesting without the guesswork, without the I'm uncertain what to do sort of thing. We're going to turn your desire into wealth for love, for influence and freedom at your command. How many of you guys would like to achieve that in this next four parts? Type a me right now in the chat. 

All right. Type a me. All right.

KY, you got that? Oh, nice. Andrew as well. Okay. 

Good. Good. All right. 

So now I'm going to take you on a journey in the next four parts of our training here to learn a little bit about the system called Cheeman Dunjia. I'm going to assume, I'm going to make the assumption that all of you guys here are new to Cheeman or new to metaphysics. Okay. 

Because this training is going to be designed for people who are new to Chinese metaphysics. Okay. Now, some of you when it comes to manifesting, you guys are already some seasoned practitioners on your own, right? You've done different types of manifesting. 

And you're probably wondering, so what's the big difference here? Well, the biggest difference is we are doing Cheeman manifesting. And it's a different system for manifesting. And and it focuses on the usage of time dimensional energies to assist you in that manifesting process. 

Okay, that's the biggest difference. So if you have been having on and off successes, if you've been doing manifesting on your own for some time, sometimes it will sometimes doesn't work. Maybe the missing link is found in the next four parts of our training. 

All right, so stay tuned. I want you to approach Cheeman, approach whatever we have to share in the next four parts here with an open mind. How many of you can do that type of me? Open mind.

Okay, you guys can do it. Okay. All right, cool. 

Make sure you are able to Yeah, all right. I see you guys have done something for is it the law of attraction? Okay, that's a good question. It's kind of, but, you know, as they say here in Malaysia and Singapore, same, same, but different.

Okay. In fact, it's quite different because there's a set of rules and structure and format to this that you can say it's actually a different approach to manifesting. Okay, it's not more difficult just to answer your question. 

It's not more difficult. It's more structured. So if you're doing it, it's not just positive thinking, oh, feel good. 

I'm going to manifest by feeling good. No, no, no, you can feel extremely bad and still manifest the outcome that you want, because we're going to follow structure. Okay, so you don't have to go and manage that feeling and all that stuff. 

Yeah. Yeah, it's going to be quite different. All right. 

Now, what if I can show you a way that can help you bend reality to your will? Would you be interested in listening and learning in this next four parts? And that's the key to using Chimendunja. And I'm going to share with you some key points. Most of you are here to manifest an outcome, I would say the first outcome would be to ignite your financial breakthrough.

I mean, who doesn't want better financial results in life, right? Would you like to do that? How many of you love that type of me right now? Okay, but we have to define what is the financial breakthrough for you, because this is very generic. Okay, for some people, it will be going to the next level in their career or their business, right? You want to take your business to the next level, six figures, seven figure income and all that. For some of you just getting started, right? You're getting started, you don't know what to choose from and you're just applying for the next job, stuff like that. 

Well, let's go deeper, right? The next point here is, we will also like to own our freedom, freedom of choice, freedom of being to do what we want to do with whomever we want to do this with and whenever we want to do it. That will be great, isn't it? Okay, now for the time being, for some of you, you might like, oh, you know, I've never experienced that before, I don't think it's possible. Let's just, for the next four parts here, we suspend the disbelief. 

We don't want to be that cynical person, you know, maybe, well, maybe it doesn't, you just talk a lot. Listen, we don't want to be that cynical person. What if, in this four-part training, there is a way to achieve that? What if, right? What if you could forge great relationships? Would that be amazing for you? I mean, how would life be if you just had better relationships? Would that be worth your time? Right? And what if you could improve your health? What if you could improve your health energetically? Would that be worth your time? You know, if you look at people with a lot of problems in life, but if health is one of them, then they only really have one problem, right? Or what if you could have a loved one by helping them improve in terms of health? Would that be worth your time? And how about at least living life with more purpose, more drive, more congruence? Would that be great for you? So, at a glance, generally, we want to be able to achieve these few things, at least in the next four meetings that we will be having. 

So, the way that me and my team have structured this training is, we're going to give you some time in between trainings to do the homework. So, this is going to be like, it's going to be different than how I've done this before, because back in the day, I would just talk straight for three days or four days. And then there wasn't much time for people to do the exercises and, you know, do part of the training itself to actually get the results. 

And, you know, I understand exactly how it works now, because back in the pandemic days, everyone has time to go online, watch the trainings and do the exercises in the morning and all that. But now, you know, everyone's got a life to, you know, you got to go to work and take care of kids and blah, blah, blah, so many things, right? So, I'm going to give some time in between each training, and you have to commit the time to actually do the exercises so that it becomes a transformational journey. How many of you would like to transform, like you're actually going to do this and make a difference? Now, it's not going to be hard. 

It's just you allocating the time to do it. So, why not, right? What if you just allocate some time here and that transforms your life? You see, most people don't get what they want, not because they lack ambition. Because deep down, they don't believe that they actually deserve it.

How many of you resonate with this? Type of one, deep down, in the subconscious, deep down corner. They don't manifest what they want, not because they don't want it, not because they don't lack the ambition or the desire. Because deep down inside, somewhere in their heart or somewhere in the corner, they don't believe that they deserve it. 

So, it's just like, you know, how many of you are consultants or you charge an hourly fee for what you do? How many of you charge an hourly fee for your services as a designer, as a consultant, as an advisor, right? Type of me right now. Yep, a couple of you. Coach, yes. 

Personal trainer, yep, of course. All right, freelancer, there you go, all right. You see, here's the thing. 

There seems to be a limit for some people to charge at a higher price. So, there is an inner thing of self-worth versus pricing. I say, ah no, the market doesn't accept my pricing. 

You know, there's no way in my type of service, I'm just a masseur, right? I'm just a masseur and this is the limit of how much per hour I can charge because that's the market rate. Whatever you just said is your perspective. You see, your inner insecurities does not reflect market reality. 

There are people who are able to command a much higher price, yes or no, type of me, if you have seen them before. All different types of services, right? Yeah, but then in our minds, we justify, you know, that person is no value, it's just making, it's just their marketing, whatever, right? You can justify it all you want but what I'm trying to say right now is because deep down, if you don't believe that you, you, the most important person now is you, that your self-worth is worth your pricing, that itself could be a limitation to why, you know, there's a limit to the income. And we are going to use Cheeman to rewrite this so that you could actually attract the true value that you deserve. 

Then you can buy back your time. And you have to understand why a healthy energy in the mind and a healthy self-identity is the new compounding asset. Type a one if you resonate with this. 

Okay, Lily, yeah, you got it? Samantha, yes? Nice. Make sure you write this down, right? A healthy mind, a healthy self-identity, that means energetically it is clean and clear, is the compounding asset. So if you don't have this clear from the start, you ain't going to manifest. 

I just told you the first key for today. In fact, today we are going to talk about that type of awakening before we can go on to manifesting. If we don't clear these blockages, you will keep manifesting the outcomes that you don't want and you resent. 

And that's why we have to change this. Okay, does it make sense so far? Alright, and there are ways to do it. There's a metaphysics way to do it. 

Now, some of you are very new here, right? How many of you are like totally new to Chinese metaphysics? If you have heard of Feng Shui, you've heard of Chinese astrology, Bazi, Purple Star Astrology, the Yijing. Yeah, let me give you a list of what kind of Chinese metaphysics. It's all Chinese metaphysics here. 

Feng Shui is the main thing. A lot of people hear Feng Shui, Feng Shui, Feng Shui, right? Bazi, some people have heard it. But what have you heard before? Just type, type out. 

Okay, if you're new, you're new to the Joviap world, we do metaphysics, particularly the Chinese metaphysics systems. Okay, so if you've heard of these terms, Feng Shui, Bazi, Yijing, right? You have this Purple Star, Ziwei, all this stuff. These are all called metaphysics. 

Okay, now Western metaphysics would be your tarot card reading, Western astrology. Okay, you also have Vastu, right? These are different types of metaphysics, but they're all metaphysics. Okay, so the system that I'm sharing with you now is called Qimen Dunjia. 

Okay, mystical doors, hiding armor. That's the direct translation, Qimen. We just call it Qimen. 

It's the ability to manifest and bend reality. That's what you need to know. Okay, the ability to manifest and bend reality. 

It's part of the Three Oracles, the Three Oracles of ancient China. And so, when I say ancient China, this is like 2,000, 3,000 years ago, where way before there was Feng Shui, way before there was astrology, the philosophers, the stages, they use one of these three systems, the Taiyi system, which is kind of lost these days. Bits and pieces of this information still survived, but you have to reverse engineer a lot. 

That is the ability to predict earthquakes, typhoons, where's the next rise of the next leader, all this world astrology or mundane astrology, some people will call that, right? What's happening around the world, that's Taiyi numerology. Then you have Liu Ren. Liu Ren is about the system about people's activities and smaller decisions. 

What's going to happen in that day, right? What's the outcome of certain small activities? Then you have Qimen. Qimen, it's about creating opportunities or bending reality to your favor. And to do that, Qimen has got many different application models. 

Okay, now don't worry, it's going to be super easy. I'm just giving you background information right now. Okay, background information, because Qimen, the name Qimen means mystical doors, kind of like gateways to different portals of energy, right? It's like opening up a portal, you know, like how this guy, Dr. Strange would do this magic and then he opens up a portal and then he travels through the portal and he ends up in a different place. 

Okay, so Qimen Dunjia is kind of like where you see the portal because you can't just open up like that. You know where the portals are and you go through the portal and the outcome that you desire is in that reality. That's Qimen portals. 

So the word Qimen means mystical portals or mystical doors. So they don't have a Chinese word called portal. So they use the word door.

Okay, so mystical doors, right? So when you say hiding armor, why is it Qimen Dunjia? Dunjia means hiding the armor. So translated as finding the outcome, getting to the reality that has the outcome that you want. So one portal could lead you to the despair, darkness, the reality that you fail. 

And another portal could lead you to the outcome that you desire, right? Success, winning, right? You're getting the relationship, being healed, getting to the outcome that you want. So again, just like the movie Dr. Strange, you have to train your ability to actually find these portals, okay? And not all portals are the same, just like the movie, right? Some portals lead you to a different dimension. But when Dr. Strange first started, he weren't able to create the most powerful portals, right? It's the, you know, a much weaker version. 

So as you train yourself to going higher and higher, you get to a point where you could get to the outcome that you want. So we call that co-creating the destiny and outcome that you want. That's the manifesting part, okay? So it's very different than just someone who's doing positive thinking, positive thinking, right? I'm going to visualize, visualize, visualize. 

That's the typical style that a lot of people do it. I'm not saying that they're wrong, right? You can do that style. But I'm saying if you add the portals in, you literally improve your success chances by the other 50%. 

So you get closer to 100%, right? Because the first 50% is you manifesting positively, right? Trying to manage your thoughts and positive thinking all the time. Whereas the other one is you really taking the action and moving through the dimensions to get the outcome, okay? So here are the different systems of, or different application models. So it's kind of like, if you're a Dr. Strange, you would have these eight different powers. 

One of the powers, the ability of foresight to forecast an outcome. So what Dr. Strange does is, he looks through the portal and see the outcome, the best part. You know the part where he says, he went on, you don't have that picture, bring the picture, I did the picture, right? He looked through one, 14 million possibilities to see the outcome, right? Yeah, he searched and put it up, right? So that is just generally, he's doing achievement forecasting.

He looks through, ah, how many ways of succeeding? One, right? So he told that secret to, who is that? Tony Stark, right? So, I mean, that was a movie and it's a bit drastic, but generally forecasting is kind of like that. You have a time stone thing called achievement forecasting, and you could walk yourself around possibilities and see the outcome, okay? Now, so the other type of achievement which is really popular is to look at a person's inner abilities, right? The inner abilities, the achievement destiny. Achievement destiny is to look through what strength, what powers, what abilities that you have, what potential psychic dimension or spiritual powers that you possess. 

That's achievement destiny, okay? Everyone has some abilities. You may think, yeah, but I don't have any abilities. Before, you are so certain that you don't have, all right? Why not for the next couple of days? Guys, you are following me so far? Type one, if you are following. 

You seem awfully quiet. Yeah? Okay. Achievement forecasting, yes. 

You like the Doctor Strange analogy, right? If you have not watched Doctor Strange, oh my God. Okay, so you don't like Marvel movies. Okay, just for the sake of this, suspend like and dislike. 

Go and watch it, okay? At least you have an understanding, right? How many of you enjoyed the movie, right? And Avengers, right? All right, cool. What the hell? Not a real movie, right? Listen, guys, it's an idea just to give you an idea of how things work, all right? Don't be too serious on this, yeah? It's an analogy. All right, so achievement destiny allows you to understand abilities, right? And I'm saying that everyone has a spiritual dimension ability. 

Some people are more intuitive. Some people could have a precognition of things, a premonition to be able to see. Some people can hear, right? So they have all different abilities, right? So that's achievement destiny.

I will talk a little bit about that in the next couple of days in different parts here. Then you have achievement feng shui, means being able to understand the energy patterns of an environment, to be able to see whether it's harmful, not harmful, where's the best winning position. That's achievement feng shui. 

And then achievement strategic execution is, what is the best way to get the outcome that I want? How do I win this? How do I get to the outcome that I desire? How do I win? How do I battle and win the competitor? So the first four is the main thing. And then on the outside, you have another four different subsystems. The achievement intuitive intelligence, the ability to consciously use intuition, to consciously be intuitive. 

Now, I know a lot of you guys who start to like this subject are already generally intuitive. How many of you are intuitive type of me right now? You're pretty intuitive? Okay, let's put it the other way. How many of you regard yourself as not intuitive? You're totally a scientific person, right? So now, you're intuitive, right? Or maybe, right? Or maybe you're intuitive, some of you. 

Okay, not to worry. What if I can show you a system where you can systematically, structurally help yourself to become intuitive? Would that be helpful? Yeah, okay. Then there's the oracle. 

What is oracle? Whenever you pray for guidance, whenever you need to ask for spiritual advice. Now, I know most of us probably say, you know, I don't need all this stuff and all that. Now, before you're so sure of this, it's like that, yeah? Have you guys been on a plane, on a flight? Yeah? So even the most, the person who does not believe in divine grace and when the plane drops for a while, you put on your seatbelt and what do you do? When it's in a very, very turbulent part, what do you, what goes through your mind at that time? Suddenly, you're agreeing, right? Come on, right? Come on, guys. 

I'm going to agree, type of one. Suddenly, it's like, oh my God. Yeah, I don't know who you're praying to, but you're going to recite a mantra or some shit.

Think about it. You did that before? How many of you are guilty of doing this? Yeah, but yet, you're scientific, yeah? Do you know whatever you're saying at that time might have zero impact on the weather and zero impact on the pilot, okay? So that's what I'm trying to say, right? There are certain times you might need some advice, right? What do I do? Should I go on this plane? Should I not go on this plane, right? Should I do this? Should I not do this? You might want to ask some simple advice from the oracle. That is how treatment works. 

Simple advice, right? When I say simple, it means what's the next right step? You know, when we are in doubt and when we are confused, when we are in darkness, the solution to this is not about the grand solution or what can I do to solve this problem immediately. Sometimes, in such overwhelming problems and frustration, the right thing to do is just to take the next right step forward. That's it. 

One step at a time, and that's where the oracle comes in, okay? So that part is the oracle, and then there's Warcraft. This is for business empires. These are for the people who are taking business to the next level, trying to win a legal case, trying to, you know, dominate an industry, trying to, you know, buy over a business, so many different things. 

I'm not sure if you guys are running your own businesses. How many of you are business owners? Just by the way, just curious. Wei Ting, okay, nice. 

CK Lim, yeah. You're a business owner? All right, nice. Cool, cool. 

All right. So business owners, if you're doing big business, at some point, you have to deal with competitors and hostile people, yes? That's where Warcraft comes in. Now, you know most of them. 

The one that I want to focus on is this. Qimen spiritual, or spiritual Qimen. The first thing I want to address is this, yeah? Spiritual Qimen is not religion. 

There is no religion of Qimen, meaning there's no this one being there that you have to pray to, and worship, and devote your life to in order to get the outcome. No. So to practice Qimen, and even spiritual Qimen, you do not need to change religion. 

What spiritual here means is self-improvement, and self-awareness, and self-awakening. It's about becoming more conscious to who you really are, to your authentic self, and ability to experience life as it should be, the ability to manifest the outcome, co-create the destinies that you want, to realize that you're actually more in control of your life than you think. So becoming spiritual does not mean more prayers in a day, and more mantras, and more devotion. 

There's no guru devotion in spiritual Qimen, okay? You don't want to be devoted to anything. You just have to be devoted to yourself, that you deserve a better life. How many of you are okay with you devoting your time to yourself to deserve a better lifetime than me? Okay? So yeah. 

So spiritual Qimen is a process to help you get to that outcome by co-creating destiny. Now speaking of which, when you talk about destiny, the first thing you want to do is, if you want to use Qimen, you gotta have a starting point, right? The starting point is this. Now, I know a lot of you have already done it, but it's always the case, right? There will be some people who didn't read your emails, and then they blame you. 

Oh, you didn't send an email to me. We send like hundreds of emails out, or thousands, I don't know. Kenny, how many emails do we send out? Thousands. 

Thousands of emails. How many times to the same person? How many times to the same person? Three, four, five? At least five times. Okay, so we have sent many emails reminding you to prepare for this. 

So please, the reason I say that is because every time we get people blaming us for not informing them, we have, all right? We have. Everyone who receives an email from us, type of me so that you can support those who are getting scolded here for no reason because my team worked really hard to inform everyone. Okay, so go and print this chart. 

Now, the reason I say that is also because sometimes the software or the link here, they can't take the traffic, and then it slows down, and then they say, oh my god, you didn't tell me to come earlier and all that. Listen, you can always do it later, right, if you can't get the chart out. But try your best to get the chart when the lines are not so busy. 

So once you get into the chart, this is like the free version of the Qiman plotter that we have, and it's super useful. The first page here is your Qiman destiny chart. There are a lot of information on this chart, and we are going to use parts of it, guys, parts of it, not all of it, parts of it. 

In fact, the first part we're going to use is to look at this section here and look at the destiny palace direction. So you see that for this guy is in the east. So I want you guys now to type out the sector that says destiny palace, your sector, type it out. 

Also east, nice. Northeast, okay. North, cool. 

South, all right. Which one is better? Okay, guys, there is no better, all right. See, immediately the mindset is always, oh, is there something better and worse? It's the wrong mindset. 

It's a question of which one you know how to use and devote some time into mastering, and then over time, you will be able to get the best outcome for yourself. And best outcome means you get to manifest the goal. You will manifest a million dollars. 

Maybe some of you have the idea that, okay, I want to get a million bucks. It's not impossible, but the way it is done, a lot of people are cynical. Ah, you know, if I don't get it by next week, this doesn't work. 

No, right? I mean, have you ever gotten 900,000 before in one go? If the answer is no, then what makes you think you can manifest a million over the next one week? You see, it has to follow the path of realm of possibility, right? If you have never achieved $100,000 before, and suddenly you want to achieve a million, it might be that jump is a little bit hard. It's possible, but it takes time to do that because along the way, there's a lot of actions and strategies you need to deploy to get to the point where you're able to legitimately generate that outcome. So the key word here, write this down, guys. 

Patience. You got to have some patience with this, okay? We'll get there somehow, but you need some patience. So you want to devote, remember I say devote to yourself, you want to devote some time, reasonable amount of time, to achieve the outcome. 

Okay? Reasonable amount of time. Three months, six months, one year for transformation. This is the starting point, okay? But you know, you're otherwise not doing anything else to improve your life. 

This might be the one thing that is important. Try it out, right? Okay, so the destiny palace is the first thing. The second thing you want to take note of is who is or what is your guardian of destiny, okay? Again, I'm addressing all the beginners here.

These are four beginners. This whole training is for beginners. I see some of you guys who already know this, who are already practitioners, great. 

I love you guys. You're coming for a refresher. But you got to understand that the pace that I'm going now is for beginners. 

And if you're an advanced user, help me out, help them. Type the answers out for them. Because some of you want more advanced stuff. 

Not in the first day though, but you might get a different perspective of it if you've learned this before, okay? So guardian of destiny is the, we call it the deity, but it's actually not a deity. It is actually a frequency of your subconscious mind, okay? If you want to explain it on an energetic level, all human beings have a spark of divine that is transferred from the divine, the pure intelligence to give us life. Now, I specifically avoid naming this. 

I will just call it blessings or grace. Because in all, because sometimes the moment we label something, immediately there will be restrictions, right? Oh, it's got to be this way, that. No, no. 

I'm just saying grace. Grace can come from all the description of divine energy to you or blessings, right? No matter which alignment you have, blessings is blessings, right? So we have received blessings at the start to receive this life. That blessing in the perspective of metaphysics has got 10 different frequencies. 

It's like your 10 fingers, right? 10 different frequencies, different yin and yang, okay? So with these 10 different frequencies, they're kind of like how your, for the scientists, this will be like this, how their subconscious mind operate, that level of frequency. So once you understand that, you could tune in and realign that frequency or give it instructions to get the outcome that you want. You see how the logic work here is a framework.

So in general, without this, you think that it's the same. Everyone just has one subconscious mind, right? That's the scientist guy saying that. Or someone say, yeah, I've got a divine ability and all I need to do is just keep praying, right? But that works too. 

But if you know the frequency better, it's kind of saying, if I want this type of music, I go to the R&B channel. If I want comedy, I go to the comedy channel. Tuning into the channel gives you that signal, but everything is just the same radio waves, okay? Now for the younger generation, they don't know what radio waves are, right? Because they don't know podcasts. 

You know, you listen to podcasts and stuff. So it's kind of like tuning into the right genre in that podcast channel. That's what it's like to tune in.

The thing is, we are studying something that's quite traditional and ancient. Chimendunja is 2,000 years old. And so they don't use the term frequencies or channels. 

They use the term deities, sun, okay? Everything to them is, they classify one word, sun. And sun can be translated as the divine being or the deity. In this case, I translate the word deity or some spiritual energy because they can't explain it. 

So they lump it as one word, sun, all right? So for us, we know that there is a difference between frequencies. So while I keep the word the guardian of destiny, what you need to know is everyone has a set, preset frequency or channel. And the first job of every practitioner, including yourself, because you're new, is to get connected to this channel. 

You got to find the fine tuning to this channel. So some of you, the channel is called chief. Can you say that? How many of you are chief, guardian of destiny? All right. 

How many of you are black tortoise? Tortoise, the word tortoise is there. Yes? Some of you, phoenix? Snake? Okay. So it's going to be one of these guys. 

This is all 10, all right? So just read out or type out your guardian of destiny. So this is one of these snake means surging snake, moon means great moon, heaven means nine heavens is the name. Now each one has their own abilities and powers. 

I'm going to share that with you in a short while. What I want you to know is for this main thing, the guardian of destiny, think of it as you have lifetime access to this channel. Think of it that you have permanent subscription to this channel.

But because you have never used it for so long, it's kind of rusty. Okay? But the channel has always been available for you. Now you got to look for it. 

You know how you're subscribed for something, but you've forgotten that you have access to it? This is kind of it, right? You have subscription to this guardian of destiny since the moment of your birth. Some of you never use the subscription. For some of you, you have used it subconsciously and so forth, right? So what we're going to do now is that we are going to reawaken this lifetime access. 

Now, not to worry, you know, some of you look at Phoenix or Nine Earth, you look at, you know, the moon and so forth. You can use all the channels later on. I'll show you how you can do that. 

For now, for the starting, your first part of this training is to reclaim your access to the lifetime channel. That's your lifetime guardian of destiny. You got it? Okay, cool. 

Everyone cool? Now, let me just give you a brief outline into the core power of each of this deities that you're born with. Okay? Now again, I wish to stress it one more time that these are not actual beings that has, you know, that needs you to worship it. It's just the name is called deities. 

It is not an actual god-like figure or fairy somewhere. Okay? They are just parts of different frequencies. Everyone type that. 

Different frequencies, okay, that you tune to. Got it? Everyone clear? Non-religious. Just want to make it super clear here. 

This is a different type of subconscious energy. Okay, so in Qiman, if you guys have the chief, if chief is your guardian of destiny, the core ability of the chief is the ability to make wishes come true. That means whatever that goes in through your mind, as your mind can conceive, chief turns it into reality. 

It is one of the most powerful wish-fulfilling deities of frequency. Okay? In fact, your whole life, you've always been supported. Whenever you need money, money will come. 

Whenever you need assistance, assistance will come. Whenever you fear something, you will not be able to do that. Now, I'm going to talk about the negative side of manifesting later on today. 

Because sometimes, inadvertently, you are also manifesting the outcome that you are manifesting right now because you're using chief in a way that it's protecting you from pain and therefore it doesn't allow you to take that challenges. Because chief gets you what you want. So you got to be careful what you think about or what you wish for because chief actually gets it. 

Okay? Now, not all people know how to wish for good things in their life. Some people inadvertently, you know, they wish for bad things. I'm not saying you purposely do it, but there could be a way that you might accidentally be doing that. 

So that's chief. Okay? So, oh by the way, if you are protected by chief, it's also very likely that you are quite divine connected. That means in general, you connect to divine, no matter which type of divine energy, in a way that is more, you resonate better. 

Sometimes you are able to see grace or divine. How many of you are chief here? Type of me right now. And naturally you gravitate towards systems like Chiman Duja. 

Okay? Chiefs are gifted in that sense. Okay? And also, if you so will it, you will never be possessed by negative forms. Here's a good thing about chief. 

Chief cannot cause harm to other people. That's kind of like a setback, but that again is not if you're not going to cause harm to anyone, but it also will not allow you to be harmed by any evil beings. So if you're always afraid of there's a ghost out there or some darkness out there, the moment they touch you, they'll be burned. 

That's the power of chief, depending on what level though. Of course, the higher level, I'll tell you later on, the more the more refined that chief energy is. So chief is good in that way. 

Okay? Nine heavens, anyone here? It's called heaven, right? Nine heavens, you? Okay? Now, if you're nine heavens, the manifesting ability of nine heavens generally means the ability to visualize. Whatever the mind can see, you see it, it becomes real. Okay? Now, not many people are imaginative that way. 

They don't see the possibility that they live a prosperous and wealthy life because there are not enough details. All right? So whatever you could see, you know the visualization thing that manifestors like to do? Well, it works best with if nine heavens is your thing, it's your guardian deity. How many of you are nine heavens again? Nine heavens here? Okay. 

Now, there's a way to train the visualization. There's a way to see it. I mean, all the people say, oh, I'm floating on cloud, walking on grass. 

That's irrelevant. More importantly is you've got to visualize the goal and how you're actually living that goal, living that ultimate life. So there's a way to use nine heavens.

Okay? That's the power of nine heavens. And in a higher dimension, nine heavens can also foresee a little bit into the future. It's kind of like a glimpse into what can happen.

Okay? That's the higher ability. So premonitions in a good way. Now, of course, if you don't know how to use the nine heavens, it turns out to be a lot of darkness, nightmares, and fear because you keep seeing stuff that you shouldn't be seeing, and it fears you because you keep wanting to see it. 

Now, you may say, yeah, but I don't want to see it. It's just fear. I'm just scared of it, but I keep seeing it. 

I see ghosts. That's because you allow that fear to dominate your power, and then the vision will keep looking at things that you don't want to see. Okay? And then you manifest that reality. 

So again, you got to train it. You got to train this type of ability. Okay, you guys good? All right. 

Nine earth. Nine earth is power to heal. It's also the deity of assets and accumulation. 

And so nine earth, people naturally have healing abilities, so they could use that. Now, a misuse of healing abilities becomes excess growth. All right? So I won't tell you about negative use of this. 

Inadvertently, some people do that, but in general, nine earth either have power of accumulation of assets and wealth, and or ability to heal, which is a great deity to have. Okay? Some of you are asking, can I use nine heavens if I'm nine earth? Yes, you can, but not now. Now, you're beginners.

We go through this four days, or this four-part training. I always say four days, but we're not doing this consecutively. We're going through these four parts, and at some point, I'll show you how you can use the other deities, even though you're not born with it. 

At this point, yes, I'm talking about the one that you're born with first, because this one, you have lifetime access. The others, that is not what you're born with, have limited access. Okay, so great moon. 

How many of you great moon? Okay, so great moon, power of knowledge, power of knowing, power of information. It's kind of like these days, your chat GPT, right? It no stinks. There's all these records and information out there in this universal intelligence.

So the question is, are you downloading the right information? Because sometimes, people ask great questions, and then they discover new knowledge, whereas some people ask dumb questions, and they discover more fear and worries. How many of you know what I'm talking about? The more negative questions you ask yourself, the more you become scared, right? No, I'm scared. I'm scared of being scared. 

A lot of times, it's not that scary. It's just that you messed up your own mind, right? So the moon can work both ways, but with the right knowledge, you could discover new formulas, unlock new skills, learn new things. You see, from where you are now to your next level in your career, or your next level in your business, your next level in your life, the missing link could be just knowledge. 

That means you don't know what you don't know yet. If there are people who have the nice cars, the nice house, the great health, right? The best family, and you are here wanting that. What do you think is missing? Luck.

You say it's luck, right? But I would argue that probably what you're missing is knowledge. You don't know how to do it, okay? So what if the moon can help you access that, all right? So generally, people with the moon are inquisitive. They like information. 

Generally, they also somehow know things, even if they didn't study the book before, they somehow know. That's the power of the moon, when used positively. And six harmony. 

How many of you have six harmony? Now, I know I'm being brief here. I'm being quite pretty brief. I just want to bring this out to you. 

This is a set of the Chimon Essentials, right? If you would like to go a bit further, there is a book called The Deities. And inside this book, now I'm going to bring a picture out so you can see it. I know it's a little bit unclear when I show it here, but this is a book that me and my team have accumulated over the years and wrote out every single one of the deities in detail about their strengths, their weaknesses, their positives, their negatives, and their core abilities and so forth. 

Everything is inside here. So if you're interested in buying a copy at the end of our four-part training, there will be an opportunity where we'll be offering some of these books for sale. Again, if you don't need it, it's fine. 

A lot of information I'm already giving out here for free in our training. But some of you would like to study a bit more, you can get the book. Each book is $150. 

At the end of our session, there'll be an opportunity for you to get a copy, all right? Now, just in case, at the end of our session here, as we're doing live broadcast, so there'll be an opportunity for some of you to win a copy for free. How many of you are interested? How many of you are interested in getting a copy for free? Yeah, this is high quality hardcover. And if you will see, the contents are very, very well written, fully researched, everything you need to know about the deity. 

Okay, so $150 gift at the end of our live stream, there'll be an opportunity for you to win one copy. Okay, I'll tell you about that later. Where was I just now? Let's see. 

Yeah, Sixth Harmony. So Sixth Harmony, it's about connection with people or another keyword for harmony is about people. Use in a great way, Sixth Harmony can get you connected to different levels of people, different types of people with access. 

Use in the wrong way, you become a hermit and isolate people. Okay, so harmony, the opposite side of harmony is not disharmony, it's about distance. Okay, so that's why each of these so-called deity or energies have their own frequency level. 

When used correctly, harmony can give you access. It's about the right people appearing at the right time, all the time. Okay, somehow people like you, it's a likability thing. 

But use in the wrong way, you dislike people and or you just want to be alone all the time. Okay, so you don't feel that it's right or wrong, it's just the way the energy works. Okay, so then you have, how many of you have the black tortoise? Black tortoise? Yeah, the black tortoise is kind of like the yin version of the chief. 

So the chief is making all wish come true and a tortoise is ability to understand all people's wishes. It has the power to access minds of others. So some people call the black tortoise the psychic, right? Or the ability to mesmerize, influence other people.

So have you seen how the Jedi master like Yoda could access the mind of other people using the force? It's kind of like what the black tortoise has, right? So in a good way, you understand markets, you understand trend, you understand the needs of others. Anyone who understand needs of others becomes a great influencer, becomes great leaders, becomes a person who can help and change the world, all right? Everyone's looking for someone to understand them. But not knowing how to use the black tortoise sometimes allows you inadvertently to access the minds of other people and they're going through darkness and trauma and suicidal thoughts and suddenly you thought, why do I feel like this? It's because you accidentally access other people's emotions. 

That's the power of the black tortoise. Now, how many of you are white tiger? Now, I know I'm being brief. I'm just trying to give you a brief understanding. 

The next four parts as we go through, there will be some repetitions where you will gain different layers of understanding when it comes to the 10 dailies, okay? So let's talk about the white tiger. How many of you are white tiger? Yeah, you're a white tiger. White tiger, keyword, stamina, endurance, energy, okay? So you say, oh, what good is having stamina, energy and all that? Everything is energy. 

Standing here on a virtual stage, talking to a bunch of cameras because I haven't seen you, is energy, right? So if I want to send my thoughts and feelings and understanding across to you, I'm literally sending energy across this camera and into you directly. You're doing presentation, you're doing sales, you're going out to talk to people, everything requires energy. Winning requires energy. 

I mean, even hating people requires energy. So the power of white tiger's ability to do that. So if you access the right energy, great. 

If you don't know how to use it, you just can't sleep. Excess of energy, right? Excessive energy unused causes rebellious nature, right? Anger, resentment, all that stuff, okay? Surging snake, how many of you are surging snake? Surging snake, cool. Surging snake is kind of like the mystical sorcerer, the wizard, who understands nature, who understands the environment, who understands how to control reality, okay? You know the keyword, bending reality, that's the surging snake. 

So the simplest way is surging snake, for example, every time if you want it, a car park is available. When traffic is back, traffic open up for you when you want it. That's the simplest way. 

And sometimes surging snake, oh no, it's going to rain. No, sometimes you think go, blow, move the clouds, and the clouds stop, move away, no more rain. That's kind of like a wizard causing the environment to change, right? That's the low level powers of a surging snake. 

The highest level somehow can move at the time markets or people's desire in a certain favor. Like people who do well in understanding trends or markets, markets are driven by fear and also driven by greed. Surging snake kind of understands that, it can move that in favor, understand trends, economies, right? Understand the weather, the climate, sentiments, power of surging snake. 

Surging snake is good at finding things as well, finding the right talent, always finding the right, the best piece, the best property. That's when it's good. When it's not good, you'll be attracting the worst people, okay? We'll talk about that later.

How about the phoenix? How many of you got the red phoenix? And so the red phoenix is the power of the spoken word. What you say, you articulate, becomes true. That's the power of red phoenix, okay? So you got to watch your words. 

Some people, you know, they say, wow, whatever you predict becomes very accurate, it becomes true. Whatever you say out, that's the red phoenix, the power of words. People back in the old days that has red phoenix become great chanters or people who speak out certain mantras to help, you know, bring blessings to a piece of land or to a whole village. 

They become the shamans back in the old days. But of course, you're not going to be a shaman, but, you know, you might have affirmations, right? But some people like to say negative shit, right? Oh, you know, everyone died, DCU died, and then the person falls sick, and then what? Accident happened. Because your words carry power. 

Some Chinese people call it wu nga choy, you know, the mouth of a crow. Simply say, the bad things happen only if you have red phoenix. So you got to be careful because the conversations that go on in your mind, and if you're red phoenix, those conversations becomes your reality. 

Yeah, now you have to watch the thoughts, right? You got to watch the conversations as well, even internal conversations. That's the power of red phoenix. And lastly, but not least, hook. 

So hook is kind of like karmic ties and bonds. So now I know it's a bit far-fetched, but people will say your past life, you know, and previous lifetime. Time dimension to human beings like you and me, we think that time is linear, right? The past, the present, the future, the future, future. 

But if you think about it clearly, the past does not really exist. If it exists, can you be in the past? You can't be in the past. You can think about it, but you can't be there. 

Can you be in the future? You can think about the future. There's a concept about the future, but it ain't the future. So this concept of time, why they say time is an illusion, it is because in this concept of time that we think, there's a past and there's a future. 

But what it really is, is there's only the now. It's a now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, now, right? Keep moving forward. And there's only this very present. 

But then when we say a past time that we're here, this now has got three different dimensions that's happening right now. The life that you have already experienced before. Now you may think, but how can I experience before because that's in the past? No. 

So if we see, it might get a little bit complex here. It's not that complex, but grab a drink and listen, all right? So when we see the divine, right? The almighty, the whole universe, the greatest intelligence ever that created this entire universe. Okay. 

And the big bang is not something that exploded in your kitchen. Yeah. So it's an actual thing that happened, right? That there is an intelligence that weren't existing before, but this intelligence wanted to experience its own greatness. 

To experience this greatness, you first have to create an alternate physical reality to be able to experience yourself. Because when you're in it, you cannot experience it. When you're out of it, you can experience it.

So that forms the duality of yin and yang. Okay. So remember when you're evolved from the original, which is all knowing that is everything that is, right? If you want to call the divine, the ultimate creator, all that is, all that is, is originally nothingness. 

And from the nothingness birth, somethingness, physical realm. Okay. Bear with me now. 

Bear with me. So the physical realm itself is a split out from the original nothingness, yin and yang. Okay. 

So that means, originally you have experienced past, present, future as one thing. It's like I'm me holding this book. This book right here already has an ending, yes or no? It has a starting and an ending, but everything now I'm holding, right? I could flip to the end and look at the ending chapter, or I can look at the starting chapter, or I can be in the middle, but everything is one piece, yes or no? Now, before this book came out, where was it? It was in here. 

There was not, it was in that void and then created this. That's the same when we're saying that the divine universe was void at first and then created a substance and the substance already contained past, present, future, just like the book. So the hook, my point is, the hook is the ability to jump chapters.

And you have got many different chapters. We like to say it's past life, but it's actually the same life. So past, present, future is the same timeline. 

It's still in the now. So the power of hook has the ability to access different dimensions of divine knowledge or experiences that you already know. So we call that remembering, not learning. 

Moon is learning. Hook is remembering. You remembered that point that you actually knew this knowledge.

So that's the power of hook, okay? Really unique, right? How many of you find this very interesting? Type of one? Cool, you want to learn more? Okay, I'm going to tell you more in the next four days, or if you stay to the end, there might be a chance for you to win a copy. How many of you like to win a copy of this? Okay, cool, right? Or you can buy it at the end, it's $150 for this book. You spent a lot of time writing this, so you support us at the end. 

Or you can win a copy, you're going to manifest a copy. Cool, all right. Let's see how it works. 

All right, cool. Now, I'm going to tell you more in a short while, but let me just go back to the big picture here first. So we are learning what, once again, spiritual achievement or achievement spiritual methods.

Now you know, okay? So if you were to ask me what spiritual achievement is, it really sums down to two things. Two very special things that I think all of us are here to learn. Number one is to connect to the divine to ask for guidance. 

We ask for guidance anyway, it's just that when you connect properly, you could connect to the chief, the nine heavens, the hulk, right? To remember a lost skill, for example, or moon to learn a new skill, whatever, right? Asking for guidance. How many of you need a bit more guidance in life, right? Learning what to do, right? Whatever, if you think about it, really, really, it's where you are now to where you want to be. As long as you have a where you want to be thing, the missing part is generally knowledge.

You need to know how to do it, or you need to know who can help you get there. Am I right? Number one, if you guys agree, right? It can't just happen to you. You can't just wake up next Wednesday and suddenly you're there, right? You got to be able to get some guidance, all right? So we learn spiritual achievement to get access to better guidance from our guardian of destiny, from our subconscious, or from divine intelligence, okay? So it's kind of like being able to tune in with the right phone number to call. 

I mean, divine intelligence always been there. It's just that you're just dialing the wrong number and sending text to the non-reply numbers. Suppose you have the right number, what do you think will happen? And the other way is to ask better questions because some people ask questions in a very annoying way. 

Have you not experienced people ask you questions and it's freaking annoying? What if you ask in a nice way? Would you get better outcome? Answer is yes, okay? Right. So, and then the other part that why we learn spiritual achievement amongst the many different achievement systems is to co-create the reality that we want. Now, we know that the universe, the divine, all the blessings, right? When we say good things is blessing, not so good thing is called curse, right? You may think, well, but divine always must bless me. 

No, it's a blessing or curse. It's a question of whether or not you're co-creating it. At the same time people prosper, there's also the same time there are a lot of people dying, okay? It would seem that the divine doesn't give a shit because the divine has its own bigger plans, right? It's got to run a universe, you know, and here you are, that tiny little fragment of life form is here on earth, which is even smaller than a dot in the sky, right? It's trying to say that this divine power has only you in mind. 

That will be a bit more, you know, the audacity to think like that, right? So, the whole world, like nature, has its own course. Nature itself is the divine. There will be life, there will be anti-life, right? There'll be growth and there'll be decay. 

That's the rule of how things work. But if you want to steer the direction to a reality that you desire, then you got to work with this frequency, okay? The currents in the ocean, it's going to operate regardless of whether or not you are going to mentally tell the wave to slow down or speed up. It's going to be there. 

If you know how to swim, you will go with the flow. If you don't know how to swim, you will drown. Simple as that.

So, the idea here is to learn to swim and bring your surfboard along so that you can co-create the outcome. The waves are going to be there regardless. So, you got to imagine that this universe has these waves. 

It's going there, back and forth, this energy. And so, once you understand that, then these two things will become the very thing that we are trying to achieve with Shiman Dunja. The first one is it can act as an oracle. 

And so, this oracle will tap into the energy pattern of the day or that period of time and align with your energy and give you an answer. Because your energy is different and that day energy, the current energy, is also different. Or you can use manifesting techniques to co-create the reality that you want.

Now, the goal, obviously, to do this is these three things. You want more freedom, you want more happiness, and you want some miracles. Agree? Would you like more freedom? Yeah? You already have freedom? Or is it the illusion of freedom? You think you have freedom, but half your life, you have to be committed to doing things that you don't like to do anyway so that the family could live, so that you have enough income for rainy days. 

You don't really have the freedom, right? So, with freedom, basically, it means that you can do whatever you want to do with whomever you want to do whenever you want to do it. Okay? That's kind of like the freedom, right? And a bit more happiness, and obviously, miracles to turn the shit things that you are experiencing right now around. Okay? That's what we want to achieve using spiritual achievement. 

Now, the first thing to get to using your lifetime access, the first thing you want to change is this thing. The first one is self-sabotage. You're already gifted from the start, gifted with a lifetime access to one of the deities, and if you do it a bit more, you can access all 10. 

But what is stopping you is generally, might be unbeknownst to you, self-sabotage. The limitations in the way you see the world and the limitations in the way you believe that you can't do certain things. Okay? So, how many of you can recognize that you actually have some self-sabotage? Type of me right now.

And if you could, type out what that is. The first step to changing this is to recognize that this thing exists in you. If you don't recognize it, you cannot change. 

You can't change something that you don't think exists in the first place. Awareness is the first key to transformation. Yep. 

Everyone got this? Nice. Okay. And the second thing that could be stopping you from manifesting or getting the outcome that you want to truly change your life, right? Financial life, relationship life, wellness life, right? Anything that you want to change.

Usually, you cannot do it because there's lack of courage to do so, or lack of clarity. So, not many people have the courage to change themselves because the initial preset alignment for most people is do nothing. Inertia is what we all go through all the time.

We know that there's something we need to do, but we don't do it. It's like saying, I know I'm supposed to be going to the gym four times a week. I just need to find a reason to get started because the reason is usually your inertia. 

You don't want to get started, right? But once you get into momentum, then you keep doing it, right? I mean, how many of you have gone through an exercise regime before? Then once your momentum, you keep doing it, but then when you stop for a long period of time, getting back into it is hard, right? So, the way to get back into it is courage to take that step. Like, how many of you have been on a diet before? What's your thing? Paleo diet, keto diet, one of my favorite keto diet, intermittent fasting, so many things, right? But if you go on a vacation and you come back after you have all this nice food, how hard is it to get back in, especially if you've gone for three weeks or one month vacation? Pretty hard, right? So, what's stopping you from changing and transforming your life? Most of the time is that courage to take the first step and clarity. So, let's talk about clarity. 

How do we actually get clarity? Clarity means what do we want? What do we truly want? It's an easy question, but a hard answer. Easy to ask this question, right? What do you want? Yeah. You ask any kid, right? Today, 18 years old to 25 years old, even to 30 years old, what do you really want? And they can't really answer you. 

Because thinking about the answer is very hard. It's easy to ask questions, very hard to arrive at a true answer. Because nobody really have, the majority of people have not actually got this figure out yet. 

That lack of clarity in itself is a bad energy, okay? If relationships, you have lack of clarity of what truly is meaningful for you in a great relationship, you'll find that most relationships you get into, you have a lot of problems, right? And your career is not improving because there's lack of career clarity and what you want to achieve actually. I just want stability. Even that you have to define. 

Why do you need stability for? Right? Who is it for? What is it for? Right? Clarity is a key. When you have clarity, a lot of these blockages to manifest will just dissipate. The question is, how do we gain clarity? How many of you are interested in knowing this? This technique.

How do we gain clarity? Tell me right now. How do we gain clarity? There are ways. There's a achievement way to do it. 

There are some people who like to do journaling. I keep writing, writing, writing. Some people do visual vision boards and stuff like that. 

Okay, whatever ways, right? That works for you. But you're learning achievement right now. So let's follow the achievement ways.

The way to do that is to work with natural vibrations. Natural vibrations means chi patterns, energies, energy frameworks. And these energy frameworks come in the form of what we call time dimensional charts. 

Remember just now we talked about Dr. Strange doing that magic thing and it opens up a portal. Yeah? Okay. So in Qimen Dunjia, the way a portal is open is to look at this charts. 

These charts are called Qimen charts. So there are charts that are for the year, month, day and hour. These are the four different types of time dimensional charts. 

It's kind of like four different powers of magic portals. And these portals or magic portals is like how Dr. Strange would access different types of different places, different dimensions and so forth. So in Qimen, these charts here are techniques to unlock the pathway or the portal to an outcome. 

So you can use it now. You don't want to just go through the portal. You can use the portal to download stuff or access energy. 

It's kind of like, you know, there's a scene in Dr. Strange part one where he's meditating, right? And he's astrally project himself. I think, Kenny, can you pull up that picture I sent you guys earlier? Right? So this is like how he access the knowledge. So for you, if you choose the right portal through natural vibrations, you could manifest or download the right type of information.

So when you try to achieve your dream, you want to get to an outcome. The missing part is how to get there. The answer is the portals, the energy realms that allow you to get to that outcome.

So let's talk about how do you get these charts. So the first chart that you guys have already downloaded, I assume it's called your destiny chart. So this is the unchanging chart and it is based on your date and time of birth, your date and time of birth. 

So when you plot your chart based on the date and time of birth, this is the dimension of energy frameworks that you were born with at the time. So it also tells you which is your guardian deity and which is your, your door of destiny, which one is your lead star, what is your, all your things related to you. And so when you're using the other charts, we are going to overlap the other charts onto this, because this is the main reference point, because this is where you are, what you're born with. 

Every other chart that is applied is always based on the overlapping onto your birth chart. Okay. Now in your destiny chart right here, you will see the small details like your destiny palace, you have your wealth palace, you have your career palace, yeah, you have your property palace, so on so forth, right.

Family palace and all that. So these sectors represent the areas of your life and when you're manifesting and you want to manifest, let's say something to do with your career, we will wait for the overlapping of the day chart or the hour chart that has the appropriate energy, in this case the portal, would arrive on your career palace. So the essential part is really a portal in the day where you see here good stars. 

Now I know I'm not writing any details here, I'm just saying if there's a good portal of energy here and it's overlapping your career palace and you're using that day to manifest and co-create something to do with your career, you will have a great outcome. Let's say that there is your family, right, as you will manifest something to do with your family. There's a family sector right here in your destiny chart and on a certain time of day or even an hour, this positive configuration, the portal opens up for this quadrant and you've overlapped it. 

You see the good energies are now overlapping your family sector, right? And so if you're using this timing to access the co-creation energy for family family-related outcome, you get a positive outcome. See what you've been missing, right? You've been, I mean some of you are manifestors, right? You've been manifesting great, I get good results sometimes, I get great results sometimes, but sometimes I don't get results at all. Maybe it's not the time yet. 

That's exactly the point. Maybe you're missing out the time, right? So what if you know the time? If you know the time, you superimpose it, you might not know how to manifest exactly in the beautiful words that other people know, but you definitely can find the right portal and the energy resides and all you need to say is a few keywords and you open up the outcome, the possibility. That's what Qiman Dunja is about in a nutshell, spiritual Qiman. 

Now there are many different types of Qiman, but this is one of the main key that people can start with. Just this alone, you will already be able to get a lot of great outcomes for your life, okay? Now there are a couple of ways you could get the portal charts for the month, the day, the hour charts, okay? First, the free one, because a lot of people like the free stuff, but obviously free is a bit limited, but at least you get the chart. Just go to the main plotter page without even logging in. 

What you see here, you get the current hour and the current day chart, okay? You already have it. Minimalist, easy to understand, free, but if you want to prepare in advance on certain days and all that, then my recommendation is maybe you want to get a copy of the Tongshu, right? This Tongshu has all the 365 days in there mapped out for you. Then there are various types of calendar you could look into. 

Basically, I'm trying to tell you there are many sources out there, okay? There's the desktop calendar version like this, and then there is the daily version, and of course, our very own, some of you already ordered this, the Qiman Manifesting Planner, okay? This is 2025, we'll have ordered the 2026 one. It should be ready around Christmas time, towards the end of the year. So there's a new format for it, we've improved it for the upcoming year. 

Really fantastic, okay? So all the charts are there, and I'm going to show you how you could use this, and I'm giving you a couple of days just for practice so you could use that along the way when we are using this throughout this four-part training, okay? If you have not already done so, can you please download it? Guys, can you put it on the telegram? Yeah, put it on telegram, right? So that is for practice, and then find your way to get a copy, okay? Or if you think, yeah, you know, a lot of people complain, if you're complaining so much, learn how to plot it yourself, okay? It just takes about two, three months, go through the process, there are free information, just go to Google and say, how do I plot a Qiman chart, and then slowly learn, okay? There's a free version, you get the simple version, or a complex version, or the planner version, so many ways, all right? The idea is that you want to get the energy map, or you can use the one that you're born with permanently, you don't look at the time dimension, but just use your own personal chart. Many ways to use Qiman. Okay, so now you know about the charts, let's go into detail as to what do we do? How do we utilize the energy in order to help us either get a divine advice, or to manifest reality? So here's how it works, okay? All Qiman charts, whether using the month chart, day chart, hour chart, any of these charts, okay, before I answer the question here, which chart is the most powerful? It depends on what type of goals, or what type of outcome you're trying to manifest, or trying to get. 

Some requires a more powerful manifesting, a longer version of the manifesting, that will require a usage of, let's say, the month chart, or the day chart. Some are lesser, easier to use, you might want to use just the day chart together with the hour chart. So I will recommend that later on, what is the correct chart to use. 

So right now, I just want you to relax and not have to figure out what is which, and all the technicalities, okay? For the time being, I will just give you, remember today is part one, is just to understand what you're capable of doing, awakening your energy and reclaiming the lifetime access to your deities, and clearing the energy to make it possible to manifest, okay? We haven't gone down to the techniques and details yet. Some of you are very excited for that, I can see that, but we'll get there, okay? Remember, we have four parts to go through, and there's exercises you need to do along the way, okay? Now, to achievement chart, whether it is a month chart, day chart, or hour chart, as long as it's achievement chart, achievement chart consists of the spirit realm, heaven realm, earth realm, and man realm. Now these four realms of frequencies are reflected in that eight sectors of the chart. 

So this is a chart here, right? This is an hour chart. Every sector, the total of eight sectors, and each one is labeled as a direction, north, south, east, west, southeast, southwest, and so forth. And inside each box here, you see a bunch of words, right? A bunch of Chinese characters with some English words, and for the beginner, sometimes it's pretty overwhelming. 

You know, you look at it like, my God, I don't know what it is. Don't try to figure it out now. In the next four parts, I will show you bits and pieces, parts by parts, which are the sections that are important. 

Because if you're trying to make sense of the whole chart, what does it mean? I see some people like to ask, what does it mean? It means nothing to you at this point in time. Don't try to make a meaning out of it, all right? Especially if people try to read the chart, can you read my chart? No, we shouldn't read the chart now. We are looking for sections of the chart to start using. 

Because learning how to read the chart will take days and months. So we're not gonna learn to read the chart, all right? This is to address the people who are asking, can you read my chart? We can't. We're going to use your chart. 

And to use it, we just need to know which of these boxes and what components are important. So that's the way we can communicate and connect with the universe, through the energies and frequencies of these four realms. So the components in the chart, when we are looking at the spirit realm, we are looking at essentially these items.

Anything on the top right corner. This is inspiration from higher consciousness. So you will see in this top right corner, components like chief, heaven, the nine earth, moon, and so forth, right? So these are the spirit realm, the higher consciousness energy.

Then you have the heaven realm, which basically governs your thoughts. The quality of thoughts is all in this top center corner, all these components here. We call this the nine stars, but what they represent is the heaven realm. 

Thoughts. So it's from inspiration to thoughts. Then you have the earth realm in the chart. 

The earth realm, it's all the eight doors. And you see the eight doors? These are the eight doors. You see life door, the delusion door, fear door.

What's that? Oh, what if I have death door in my destiny palace? Doesn't matter. Again, the reason I'm saying is we're not going to interpret this. I know it's intriguing, how do you pronounce this word? Intriguing, to try and find out whether you're doing or not doing, it's irrelevant. 

Just hold that thought until the end of this four days, four parts, maybe we'll talk about it. We're not going to interpret your chart. The interpretation is a different study.

I'm talking about using the chart. You're not going to need to know what the death door, fear door means in your life, okay? In your destiny palace, okay? At this part, we are only going to look at what is needed to manifest an outcome, regardless of whether you're fear door, death door, or whatever door is in your destiny palace. So therefore, we ain't going to read the chart. 

It's not important. We want to know at this time what to use and when to use it. So the earth realm are the types of doors, and then you have the man realm or the human realm or people realm are the results you experience in life, okay? So in a nutshell, it comes from this.

If you look at how the divine governs everything, you go from inspiration from higher consciousness that generates your thoughts. So your thoughts are not really your thoughts. Your thoughts are whatever the divine or this higher consciousness can somehow insert that in your inspiration to think about it. 

And then you have that leads to actions and the actions lead to a reality. So that's the concept here, okay? So when we look at a destiny chart, what we are essentially looking at is one is your static chart, the one that you're born with. And on this side, you have the dynamic chart. 

And dynamic is month, day, hour. Now, of course, there's a year chart as well, but we're not going to use the year chart, the month, day, hour. Can you see three different charts? Now, what do you do with this? It's overlapping. 

So you take this as base and you take the day, for example, and overlap it. Now you see what energies arrive at which aspects of your life. You look at your own life chart, right? Your own destiny chart. 

If I remove all the components and just leave the so-called palaces like this. So you can see here, you have your destiny palace in the West. You have your karmic palace in the West. 

You have your subconscious palace in the West. You have a career palace in the Northwest. You have your family palace in the North. 

You have your wealth palace in the Northeast. You have your knowledge palace in the Southeast. So on and so forth. 

This is what we want, okay? What's that? You want to know what the karmic palace is? Not now. Relax, chill, right? We are not going to explain each and every palace at this point. We just want to know where they are. 

And when we come to that part, it's only the first day, right? As we unfold, manifesting to family matters, manifesting career, manifesting health and wealth related aspects, we must at least know where we want to look, right? So now we know where these sectors are. When we look at the dynamic aspect, the dynamic aspect will then overlap over your original NATO chart at certain days and months. And that is when you are going to initiate very special Shiman commands to manifest the outcome, okay? I will show you exactly what you need to do.

And when the time comes, I will explain what the karmic palace or whatever palace that need to be as we go through those examples, okay? Now, before we could do that, the first thing we need to address is manifesting. You first need to know that people cannot get what they want because they confuse manifesting with wishing. What we're doing here is not wishing for something.

In Shiman, you do not wish for something to happen. You do not pray for something to happen. Now, I'm not saying prayers are wrong, okay? You can pray whatever you want, right? Because Shiman is not a religion, so you don't have to pray to Shiman. 

So you do not pray. Because in Shiman, you are commanding the energies of this universe or you're controlling it, giving it direction. Remember the end, you may think, ah, but I cannot control divine power, it's blasphemy to do that.

This is not, okay? It's not. This is your own subconscious. You do not get penalized just because your heart is beating, your liver is functioning. 

It's part of your body, your given birthright. So you just need to use it so you don't get penalized. The fear needs to go, all right? And if you're wishing, you see, the thing with wishing is it always comes from not having, that's why you're wishing for it, okay? So wishing on the opposite end is actually a form of scarcity because you're wishing that things would turn out like that. 

So you're not having it, right? So anytime you're coming from a negative perspective of scarcity, of not having, the chances are you're not going to get it anyway, okay? So instead of wishing, you're going to manifest to become. That's the biggest difference. And I will show you how, right, along the way. 

And some of you actually think that, you know, we're either manifesting or we're not manifesting, right? You know, as long as I don't think about manifesting, I'm not manifesting anything in my life. It's not true. Everyone manifests. 

It's whether they're consciously doing it or unconsciously doing it. So I'm going to show you this here. And you need to identify which of this category you kind of fall into because each one will have a different solution when they are doing the achievement manifesting, okay? So obviously, there's those who want something and you're wanting something. 

And there are those who are unconsciously wanting something or those who don't want something, but they are unconsciously manifesting what they don't want. And that's the worst one to be. So the first one is at this section. 

They are unconsciously manifesting things they don't want. And surprisingly, a lot of people are in this category. All these, they don't like, oh, I hate this. 

I hate that. You know, I don't like this person. I don't like the person. 

And you end up having this type of person in your life. You end up being in that situation. The things that you hate most comes through for you because you're unconsciously manifesting that outcome.

And that's quite dangerous. And that's what the whole study of spiritualism is to get out of being from unconscious to becoming conscious. At least if you're conscious about it, there's a chance that you could actually get yourself out of it. 

So there are those who are consciously manifesting things they don't want. They are aware of it, but still they can't help themselves from thinking negatively, from talking negative to themselves, and somehow positioning themselves in that situation where they get bullied, right? They get ostracized and so forth. These are the unconscious manifestors.

And if you think about it, unconscious manifesting is you are accidentally giving the wrong instructions to your lifetime guardian of destiny, and it's generating the outcome as per your instructions. It's the only difference is you're unconscious about it, right? For example, the chief, you know the chief always protects you. That's the job of chief, right? It's about justice, about protection. 

So suppose you are very afraid of being betrayed, right? You're so afraid, right? I really hate betrayal, and I can't stand breakups and betrayals. So the only way that chief knows how to save you from having the harm of being betrayed is to keep you away from having a relationship in the first place. And so you attract nobody. 

Remember people attracted you, somehow the chief will send out a signal, repel, repel, repel. So you're safe because the job is to keep you safe because you don't want that. You don't want to expose yourself to some adventure. 

So the chief keeps you safe, right? So sometimes you may say, I hate getting sick. I don't want to get food poisoning and all that. Then the chief will prevent you from traveling. 

You never get a chance to travel. No one invites you to travel because you don't want to take the chance. So the chief just protects you from it. 

So sometimes protection becomes the problem. It's like a mom who's overprotective of the kids. You know what that means, right? How many of you are a mom right here? Have a me. 

At some point that you become overprotective or you see moms that are overprotective of their kids and never allow them to do anything dangerous. And then the kid turned up to have never experienced life before. That's kind of like the chief. 

And nine heavens, visualization. I mean, sometimes if all you see and grown up in life, growing up with your parents or with your family is negativity, right? Because you see your parents argue all the time. You see your parents fight physically, right? You have all these things that you see. 

So all you could ever imagine is all these things is because you see it and that's what you visualize. And that's the outcome that you generate. You don't have a better role model to envision yourself to be.

So not your fault. It's just that you didn't have an alternative. You didn't know that it's possible. 

So even the nine heavens can work against you in that way. It's not making you bad. It's just following your instructions, right? Nine earth loves to accumulate assets, right? And healing. 

You think, yeah, how can I go so bad about it? Well, at a negative level or you're unconsciously manifesting. You know those people who are health freaks that they need to measure their micros and macros and all that stuff. They measure exactly what they eat, they inject themselves, they biohack until they go crazy, right? They jab themselves with all this, whatever, right? Just trying to hack their systems. 

And then there are those who does nothing and live to 80s, 90 years old, right? And some of these will hack themselves and then they die early, right? And accumulate. Nine earth loves to accumulate. And then what do they do? They accumulate shoes, sneakers, boxes, stuff. 

Everywhere there's stuff. And when they travel, they take the whole room and pack it into one suitcase and they travel with that stuff, right? So that's a very nine earth thing when you're unconscious of the manifesting. Harmony, for example, loves to multiply, right? Loves to multiply, loves to connect. 

And so when you're not, you're unsure of what you're consciously manifesting, the harmony can turn into greed, temptations, overeating, overwhelmed, right? Overdoing everything, right? So they grow fat, they grow lazy, right? They love stuff, right? Somehow they overindulge, right? And they get tempted to, instead of sticking to one partner, they have multiple partners, right? They take takeaways, right? You know what that means, right? So they have stuff like that. So it's a negative manifesting, okay? The deity is not good or bad. It's a question of unguided or guided, okay? Moon, for example, is the power of knowledge. 

But when unguided, unconscious, over analysis, burdened by information, now you know too much. You cannot unsee what you have seen. It becomes paralysis from a need to know to a process or a level where you can't do anything different or more because you're too scared now. 

Snake, for example, from ability to sensing the environment and understanding how things work and finding the right people to constantly getting oversensitive about people's behaviors. Oh, why do you smell so much? Oh, why do you breathe so loud? Oh, you smoke too much, right? So they're constantly attracting the wrong type of people. And the very type of people that you'll try to avoid, the betrayers and backstabbers, you seem to attract them the most. 

That could be the snake that is unconsciously manifesting and you're wondering why you're not successful or why you have all these problems, right? The hook, we know hook has the power to access previous lifetimes, right? Karmic powers. But when it's unconsciously manifesting, you could access traumas that you've been before. Whether it's this life, past life, or a future life, right? Memories that don't belong to you but is unlocked and now you're feeling it, you remember stuff, you see people and you seem to have a history, someone your first time you meet and you hate them, you don't even know why. 

The hook when misaligned can cause that. Guys, are you resonating with the stuff I'm saying? Type of one. You following? Yeah? Okay. 

And the tiger. The tiger is excessive energies. So we know excessive energy can do what? Well, it can turn into aggression, into hate, into resentment, right? Too much hate is also energy, you know? And you have the phoenix. 

Well, we know about the phoenix. Phoenix is about power of words and articulation. So, I mean, some people talk shit to others and they generate bad verbal karma, right? But what's worse is when you talk shit about yourself.

No, I don't think I can do it. I'm not as good. I'm not like this. 

I'm not like that. I'm like this. I'm like that. 

You know how they like to justify how they are, right? Why they say, yeah, you know, in my past, my father never taught me this, you know, this, this, that, that. The way they describe it becomes their reality, right? So that's the power of phoenix. And then you have the black tortoise. 

The black tortoise is the power of tuning into people's minds and influencing others. But on the reverse side, you sense darkness. You embody the pain of other people. 

You want to take shortcuts and you get into fear or darkness or even play around with black magic because it's a shortcut to getting outcome. So, the key is you got to be very careful that even you are, when you're trying to manifest, you at least stay away from the dark side of manifesting. Then you don't want to be unconsciously manifesting those bad things.

If you're already experiencing it, fret not, we have a solution for you right here, okay? Now, so you want to get to a side where you are consciously manifesting the outcome. Before you get there, some people who have really good parts of charts or they have really good friends or they attend a lot of this type of classes, for example, a lot of metaphysics classes, then they tend to know what they want. You know, at the end of the day, if at least you know what you want in life with some form of clarity, there are higher chances of you getting it, okay? So, they might be getting what they want unconsciously. 

So, time and time on off, they might get what they want because they're unconsciously manifesting the stuff that they want. Now, what we want to get to is we want to consciously manifest the things that we want. Then we become true creators of the life that we desire. 

So, let me put back all this together again. Spiritual Qiman, one side is about the oracle, asking for advice, and on the other side is co-creating destiny. Co-creating destiny is what we're talking about manifesting. 

But you have to be conscious about manifesting. So, how do we do it? What's the technique here? Introducing the Qiman manifesting framework. So, the Qiman manifesting framework is the exact steps that you'll be learning in this four-part training to consciously manifest the outcome or the reality that you want. 

There's a step-by-step. So, instead of just positively thinking, using shitloads of affirmation words and be smiling in the morning and all that, besides that, I'm not saying don't do that. If you'd like to do that, keep doing it. 

But here is a framework that if you follow the framework, you will notice that it can 10x your previous efforts in manifesting. In fact, it will get you to the results way faster than just you doing positive affirmations the whole day. And no, it does not require you to meditate for 15 minutes in the morning every day, right? Or do a lot of breath work. 

Nothing wrong with doing that, guys. I'm not saying you shouldn't do it. Do it if you like to do it. 

I'm saying maybe just spend five minutes doing this. Follow the framework. Follow the process. 

It adds on and multiplies whatever your efforts are in trying to get to the outcome. And if you're not already doing any manifesting, then it's great because then you can follow this method. So, this method is simply this.

You start with intent, okay? I'll show you exactly how to do that because intent defines the clarity that we need. What do we intend to manifest clearly? Then the second part is about alignment. And alignment means you need to align to the vibrational energies. 

Remember the portals I told you about? The Chimun, the mystical doorways, those are the portals. You want to align to the heaven, earth, man, spirit realm, whichever the energies that you want to align to, to get the outcome that you wrote down in intent. So, you want something, you find the right chart. 

I repeat, you want something in the intent, you find the right Chimun chart for it. And then you initiate the command. You initiate the command, meaning the instructions. 

What is the instructions that you want this energy, this vibrational energy in the Chimun chart to do? What do you want your own guardian of destiny to do? What is the assignment? What is the task? And once you assign the universe and the energy what to do, you too need to do your part. So, what is your part? What are the things that you are contributing to the outcome? The part on conquer means I'm going to go out there and take action. I'm going to go out there and take massive action to get to my goals. 

Now, you see, the difference between a lot of people with success is simply this, right? If you outwork everybody, you really put in the effort. You take hundreds of different actions towards your goal. You don't give up. 

You stand up every time, you make mistakes, you stand up, you keep on doing. As opposed to the one person that, you know, give up on the third try, for example, and don't really take the extra amount. If you do all that, really put in the effort to go all that, what is really missing in this equation is just the blessings or grace to happen, right? Now, I use the word grace or blessings because this is universal, right? Some people would call grace or blessings the creator. 

Some will have a name for it, the universe or God or whatever, right? It's still a blessing. When that happens, together with all your conquering your hard world, the outcome is inevitable. You will get there. 

As opposed to you just working hard, but when there's no grace happening in your life, you don't get there, right? So, how many of you believe that grace is always available? How many of you believe grace is out there? It's always available. Yes or no? Type a me right now. Yes? Grace is always available. 

The question is, are you available for grace? Let me tell you what people who don't, who are not available to grace. So, grace can take many forms, right? You know, the problem is we have a preconceived idea of how grace should be. It needs to be this, it needs to be there, it needs to come in the form of a white dragon, right? Descending from heaven, needs to be like angels, it's got to have angel wings, it's got to have a halo around the head and all that, right? But the thing is this, grace happens in all different forms. 

Sometimes your biggest challenges or so-called setbacks are in fact grace happening. How many of you agree with this? Type a one, right? You agree? The problem is it didn't happen the way you want it to happen. So, we complain about things that it's not convenient or nice to us, right? Even if the divine appears in front of you today in a human form, the first thing is you smell, I don't know why you behave like this, I don't like your face. 

You're already complaining. Before I chance this person even be nice to you, you already have that preconceived idea of what is nice or not nice. These cannot be God-sent, because God-sent cannot be smelly. 

I cannot stand it, all right? Some people, grace can be any form. You see cockroach, kill cockroach. God cannot come in the form of cockroach. 

How do you know this is all universe creation? You just killed your one messenger, right? So, the thing is this, I'm not, the cockroach is an extended far-fetched example, but here I am trying to say to you is that we have preconceived idea of what divine should be. Now, the reason I say that is because validation will come where you will see signs from the universe that will tell you, okay, I got what you want, you did your part, leave the rest to me. Leave the rest to me. 

It's coming, okay? So, the whole process here is like a process of command. You set the intent, align, command, conquer, and then validate. Now, a lot of people when they manifest something, they, how many of you feel the same? You feel, I'm not really sure, you know, I have this doubt, this small doubt, right? And doubt kills manifesting, you agree? Right? All doubt, and you can't get over, overcome it, right? I'll show you is how many of you have ordered food from Uber Eats or Grab? Yeah? You've ordered food from Uber Eats and Grab? Okay. 

So, it's kind of like that. You set an intent, you look through the app, right? You place your order, and then you expect the order to come. Is there any moment of doubt that once you order, this order will not, will not eventually won't come? 90% of the time will come because the expectations will come, and then you will be setting up the table, getting the food ready, right? Getting the table ready for the food to come. 

You do your part, right? You pay the money, expect it to come, and in the end, you will get notifications that it's coming on the way, and then you go down and collect your food, right? That's kind of like how manifesting with the framework works. You set your intent, you align to the universe energies, right? Which one, right? Which order page, what item? And then you command, set the order, this is what I want, two cheeseburgers, right? Five chicken wings, 10 Diet Cokes, whatever. And then you set up to do your part, you're going to set the table up, you pay the money, right? You set the table up, tell the kids, get ready to eat, and then you receive notifications, validate, for it to come. 

That's how manifesting should feel like. It should not feel like, gee, I wonder if I did order the five burgers, maybe it's going to not send me burgers, and it's going to send me, you know, some chow kway teow, right? Or some noodles. You didn't order noodles, it's not going to send you noodles, right? So that is the process of expectations, okay? Now, I've put this entire thing here in that document that I just sent you, all right? So this document here, the way I've structured the five part, and I'm going to be going through this in the next three parts of this training, section by section, okay? I'll show you that you need to get some of these downloads. 

And you can do this yourself, of course you can do this yourself, it's just a lot of tedious work, right? Or you can get the ready-made copy, which saves you time, or you can do it by hand. Some people love to do it by hand, great, okay? And nowadays with AI designing, you can design your own if you want to. This section here, you can see part one, it says your intent. 

And the whole section here, I will show you how you can fill in the blanks in the correct way to actually define with clarity and full determination of what the intent is. And then we're going to go on to the section of alignment. That's where you're going to align with your internal achievement energy, as well as which realm of energy you're tapping into. 

You can tap to the divine, you can tap to the universe, the spirit, or you can tap to heaven, earth, or man. Then the section three, part three is about the commands, right? You're going to use the right commands. I'll show you how you can give the right commands. 

You're not wishing, you're not hoping, you certainly are not begging, okay? When you beg, desperation does not manifest, remember that. Desperation will never ever manifest. You do not do this out of desperation. 

And then there is the part four, which is conquer, means you want to select the right time to take the right achievement activity. And I'll show you how you can use that as well, okay? And then part five is you need to validate. Validate means you want to take note of the evidential occurrences. 

The universe is giving you what sign? Sometimes 111, sometimes 444, sometimes you wake up at this exact minute 259, right? Those are numbers, sometimes it's words, sometimes you hear a voice, right? So that's validate. And then you're going to write down the wins and achievements of the day. And then you're going to write down what you're grateful for, because gratefulness enhances and speeds up the outcome. 

Okay, I'm going to show you how, all right? Now, if you have not already done so, I will give you a couple of these ready-made documents for the next couple of days until part four, all right? So you can actually practice this along the way. I'm not going to give it to you if you're going to use it, right? You can download it here. Yeah, follow this and download this copy. 

Or for those of you who already have the, you ordered the book and you got the book earlier on, then you could use that. So this is the the current year and then there's also the future coming year, all right? Good. Now, let's get to the part where you could actually be super successful to manifest, okay? To do this, I summarize the entire practice of achievement manifesting into just this one statement. 

When all four realms are aligned, all manifestations become reality. When all four realms align, that means your thoughts, that means your mind, your emotions, your being, your physical being, and the divine energy is all aligned with one direction, as in to one purpose, the manifesting will become real. What it means is if you are thinking about this, but behaving like that, that's different direction, or you are saying you want this thing, but actually you're feeling wise, you're wanting that thing, or you're not aligned internally with your mind and thought and body, then the outcome cannot be manifested. 

Like for example, you say you want to manifest losing weight. So to manifest losing weight, energetically, you connect, right, with the right motivations and all that. Now you're motivated, you're aligned. 

But emotionally and physically, you must also want to lose weight, meaning you actually will physically go and exercise or take up certain sports or go to do something. So now you're physically saying, okay, my physical body also want it. I'm seeing the doctor, I'm taking some medication, I'm doing some treatments, I also want it physically. 

What's missing is just the timing. Once you get the timing as well, now you lose weight. You understand my point? So a lot of people say one thing, but then do the other. 

So you want to be successful, but then you don't pay the price for success. You want to have a great relationship, but you actually don't do the thing that a great relationship needs, which is to build trust and build the foundations of trustworthiness, for example, right? So to get all these four realms aligned, we have to have some clarity of what we want. So gaining clarity is the first step, because if we don't have clarity on what we want and want to achieve, we ain't going to get what we want. 

The second part is getting into flow, getting into the energy of the achievement chart, getting into the portal. So gaining clarity, getting into flow, gaining clarity, getting into flow, manifesting becomes possible. So gaining clarity is your job to go inwards and find out exactly what you want and whether you're prepared to do the work. 

And getting into flow means let's align this with timing. Okay, now let's focus on gaining clarity, shall we? Gaining clarity is a process that you need to understand that it's needed throughout your life. And it happens for different aspects of your life. 

Clarity is needed in different stages of your life and in different areas of your life. Okay, different stages. As a kid going to school, it's a different stage of your life.

Clarity is needed to decide what to study, who you befriend with, and so forth. As you are deciding, as you get older, you want to get married, not get one, want to get married, that is another stage you need some clarity on. Some people, it's better off being alone, right? Staying single. 

Some people are better off having a partner, right? Or what do you want from a relationship? Different stages. You want to change career, for example, you have to also, that's a different stage. You need clarity in that aspect as well. 

Different areas of your life, your career, clarity, wealth clarity, investment clarity, right? Well-being clarity, so many things. So clarity is needed in different areas of your life. But to get there, you just need to do this thing with Qimen. 

The step is to get into your Qimen Destiny Palace direction, like so, okay? So this is a sitting direction. You sit with your back towards your Qimen Destiny Palace direction. You sit with your back towards the Qimen Destiny Palace direction. 

Because you are, now it could be any direction, this case is east, but for some people it might be northwest, some people might be west and so forth, all right? So you're going to connect to your destiny direction, your Qimen Destiny direction with your back towards the direction, and you're going to connect with your lifetime guardian of destiny, the one you are born with. Some of you are chief, some of you are nine heavens, some of you are black tortoise, some of you are moon, doesn't matter, okay? You connect to your lifetime guardian, and basically you're going to ask for clarity. Now to ask and gain clarity, there are several steps. 

So I'm going to show you all these steps, and you're going to practice this the moment this event, day part one is over, tomorrow and day after, you're going to do a couple of times. Maybe the first time it didn't work, it may take a couple of times, because you haven't done this before, right? So before we begin, you want to think about what areas of your life do you want clarity on. Career, like what do you really want for your career in the next one year, five years, ten years, what do you really want? Why do you want it? Why is it important? Some of you are like, I don't know, I just want to get a job, make ends meet, make a living.

That sort of bullshit answer, not good, not deep. You got to have deep answers, right? Why you do the things you do, that brings wisdom, right? So you have that aspect, that area of life, can be health, can be relationships. The moment you decide, once you gain clarity, the decision that follows becomes easy. 

But until you get to that point, most decisions are hard. Until you get to the point, what is that? Unable to gain clarity, right? So step one is reflection. Backing towards this direction, you reflect on why you want something, why is it important, why if you don't have this, what bad things or unpleasant things can happen, and why is it a must that you get this? Certain questions of understanding.

The second thing is observe. So you want to back toward this direction and observe, has your actions been leading you to happiness in this area? Has your thoughts and emotions, whatever they are, describe them in detail, led you to this outcome that you wish to manifest? Has your circle of friends, you observe, just observe, don't judge. It's like, are they supportive, non-supportive, right? What have you done, what have you not done? Just observe, like as a third party, you're seeing it, right? You see, people always talk about mindfulness, mindful, mindfulness. 

Then they say, listen to the rain, listen to the breathing. No, no, no. Mindful means observe. 

You step back and observe your life, right? In relation to that area that you wish to gain clarity, you observe what has been going on, right? Were your actions supporting or not supporting? Just observe, no judgment. The third component is to articulate, to become fully aware of the level of energy that you currently have towards this particular subject matter. So you're not trying to describe the subject matter. 

You just say, when they talk about relationship, is it from zero to 10? Do you feel warm? Do you feel trusted? Do you feel happy? The level of vibrational energy. Sometimes you mentioned that word, right? You talk about your spouse or your partner. It used to be a 10. 

Now it's down to a seven. And then for some of you, it's down to a three. Some of you are like zero, right? Whenever you mentioned, oh, that person, that's a, you know, the energy level goes down. 

That will help you win clarity because the highest clarity comes from when you are actually at your highest level of vibrational energy. When you're at lower levels of vibrational energy, usually it's frustration. Usually it's confusion.

Usually it's sleepless nights. Usually it's a lot of anger that usually you don't know what to do. The higher the vibration, the sense of certainty is usually higher. 

So you want to just be aware. I'm not trying to ask you to push the energy up. I'm saying, what's the energy, right? Like what you're learning right now, whether or not you're absorbing whatever I'm sharing with you in this part one. 

Also, it's your own energy right now. What's your level right now? Level zero, zero, level 10 is the highest. Now, some of you nine, eight, nine, wow, 10. 

Oh, come on, right? I don't know. You've got vibrational energy. Okay, cool. 

Right. But you truly want to see some of you, if you are doing, if you are approaching this at level three or level four, you're probably not going to remember a lot of this stuff because you get distracted along the way, right? Some of you, hopefully you stay in the game, right? You want to be part of this training and stay in the game, right? You got to stay alert. So being aware of the energy level itself, your presence itself, how present are you spiritually, energetically, mentally, that tells you whether or not you have clarity. 

Now, while backing this direction, you can also write down, ideally, what would be a nice outcome? What would be a nice, perfect situation? You've never tried writing in round, right? I mean, you've not won a lot of things, or you've won a lot of things, but have you tried articulating this, describing it in writing? Because there's power in writing. Being able to describe the outcome that you wish to be in, the reality that you wish to be in. Now, some of you say, well, I don't know that many words. 

Can I check GPT, this stuff? Preferably not, okay? Because you want to use your own words to express. Even if you have lack of words, use whatever word that you know, because it has meaning for you. It is meaningful to you, whereas a computer-generated thing is not meaningful to you. 

It's somebody else's words, you want to use your own words. Try that. The fifth thing you can do while backing this direction to gain deep clarity is to think about in the past.

What sort of emotions or moments that brought joy, happiness, or positivity to your life? Now, just record it like something someone said, and that emotion was so vibrant and happy. You heard that from someone. You heard a thank you, you were in a situation, you saw an environment that brought really positive emotions. 

So describe that moment and record it down. Because by doing so, now you know, listen guys, now you know what actually makes you happy. Because otherwise, you don't know what makes you happy. 

Oh, I want to be happy, I want to be happy. Why my relationship, girlfriend don't make me happy, boyfriend don't make me happy. Why, why, why? You're supposed to make me happy. 

But you don't know what made you happy in the first place, right? So why don't you describe that moment? Is it when they said something? Is it when they did something? Or when you experienced something? When you hear something? What was that one moment? Okay, record it down because that's what clarity is about. Okay, the sixth thing you can do is to determine what type of help do you actually need? A lot of people don't know what help they need. They say, I need this. 

Okay, but what's the assistance you need here? What can't you do by yourself? Now, if the tempting answer is, I don't know, think, think true. That's the process of gaining clarity. If you want someone to help you, you've got to first know what you need help in, in the first place. 

Not knowing an answer to this is in fact why you're stuck. Determine what type of help that you need. And if you could describe it, you could get it. 

Okay. And lastly, you want to deep dive into that subject that you chose. Like you really deep dive in it. 

You don't want to just surface level know about stuff. You want to go deep into it because the more concentration and devotion you give to the subject, the clearer and clearer the pathway becomes. I repeat, the more devotion and energy and focus you give to that subject, the more the pathway opens up for you. 

Okay. So now you gain clarity. Now, the next part is to get into flow. 

Alignment. That's what alignment means. So alignment means you need to align spirit, mind, emotions, body. 

That's what alignment is like. Okay. So a complete alignment of these four realms equals good fortune. 

A complete alignment of these four realms equals good fortune. It means that whatever you wish for, or you want to manifest will now have the support of these four realms to bring forth into reality. Okay. 

So you need to write down what you want. This is important. This is how we set the intentions, by the way. 

Rule number one, you have to be extremely clear. Extremely clear on what do you want or what don't you want. The clearer you can write, the better the outcome would be. 

Step number two, rule number two, it has to be within your current realm of possibility. If it is not within your current realm of possibility, you say, ah, you know, your cynical thing is, I want a million dollars. I want to manifest a million dollars. 

I got to have a million dollars. I know why I want a million dollars. But the million dollars is this. 

You're currently only making $80,000 a year. That jump from $80,000 a year, jumping to a million dollars is going to be out of your realm of possibility. Your brain, your hair, your heart, your balls won't believe what you want to manifest. 

And this disbelief, the body is against it. When the body is against it, the manifesting won't come through. Okay.

So for the starters, it needs to be within the realm of possibility. And for those who want to go beyond the realm of possibility, that's for long-term subjects, long-term manifesting. Okay. 

So start with something that is within the realm of possibility that is still okay. If you work a little bit harder and do certain things right with one or two contacts, you'll get there. Important. 

Rule number three, be specific and determine the timeframe. Because the timeframe allows you to set a time to collect or gain the thing in which you manifest. Because otherwise it'll be forever, right? So our timeframe is not a specific day.

It's a period of time. I would divide the year into four parts and put it as, you know, first quarter, second quarter, third quarter, and fourth quarter. Within the three-month timeframe, it is pretty reasonable for most smaller desires. 

Okay. So you want to go a timeframe where you're going to get the goods. And rule number four is the most important.

The most important, in fact. It is the rule that says you must know that your goal is actually worth your time in pursuing this. I say this because if you make flimsy desires, because you know, it doesn't matter, it doesn't worth my time. 

I'm just doing it for fun. I'm doing it for fun. The moment you say that, it won't happen. 

I'm doing it for fun. No, you're not doing it for fun. You're doing it for real. 

Because it's worth your time. If it is not worth your time, your body, your energy, your soul, your heart will not put in the energy exchange to bring forth this outcome for you. Okay. 

So it's got to be worth your time in doing this. So if you're not serious, in other words, if you're not serious and committed to this, the goal will not happen. The wish, the desire to manifest, the outcome will not happen. 

Okay. So if it's worth your time, it will be a command that will happen in your favor. And so I give you this very important secret here. 

Okay. You must, you must take note of this. Okay, guys. 

Oh, you got to go early. Is there a replay? Guys got a replay? This one. We call it what this time? The goal pass. 

Okay. So why don't you put the thing up? It's easier for them to see. Yeah. 

Yeah. Okay, guys, if you want the replay, there is a goal pass for the replay. Otherwise, everyone's watching this live, right? Yeah. 

So, and if you're staying to the end, I mean, even if you're getting replaced, it's not going to be the full replay, right? There's going to be most of the important parts, but some parts we want to encourage everyone to watch live. Because if you commit the time that itself, it's a commitment that you'll be serious in this and your manifesting will come true as well. Right. 

It's part of training. That's why we prefer that everyone attends this live. I know life gets in the way, but if you can allocate time to do something, the results will be much better. 

But if you really have to get the replay, then there is the, what do you call it again? Goal. Goal pass. Yeah. 

Get the goal pass and get the replay. Okay. All right. 

So if you're staying to the end, I will give you a special gift for today as well. Right. Okay. 

Now, so gaining clarity and getting in sync with flow. Now, how to get in sync with the flow is that you choose good timing. So, how do you choose, right? How do you choose good timing? So remember you have your achievement destiny chart. 

So this is your achievement destiny chart. Now your achievement destiny chart, I make it the easiest way. Right. 

So this is a destiny chart with the destiny palace in the East sector. Can you see? Destiny. Okay. 

So just think of your destiny as an East sector. So when you're going to do the manifesting or you're going to use spiritual achievement, you're going to be backing the East and you're going to be facing West. Backing the East means now you're sitting on or you're going into the East dimension. 

The East is your destiny palace. Okay. But you can't just sit there and, okay, everything's going to be good. 

All right. What's I'm going to do? All right. You're going to wait for this thing called the day chart. 

It's called the day chart. Can you see the day chart? Now the day chart, the East sector, there's a bunch of components as well. Yes or no? Every day there are different components in the East. 

So when a bunch of good components arrive at the East, that means this component has entered into the East sector to which it's part of your destiny palace. Now the portal is open. So you don't get this every day. 

You get this time and time again, when good energies arrive. Now, of course, you probably would be thinking what is good, what is not good. Okay. 

We've color-coded, right? So this color is all the good stuff that you see. I'm going to label it out here. So these are all the good guys, right? All the good components. 

Even when you print out the charts, when you look at the charts that you see now, they're highlighted in the different color. And then the dark components are usually the not so desirable, unless specific reason, type of components. So if a box like the East, here's an example. 

There's all the good stuff in the East. That means on this specific day, this destiny box, which is yours in the East, now has the superpower, the portal's open. So what do you do, right? Well, on this day, you could do two things. 

Spiritual achievement has, the first one is to ask for advice. So if you need clarity, you could use this day to ask for clarity. That's the best. 

And the other one is to co-create destiny. So you could use this day to write something, to activate certain things in your life. Okay. 

So there are ways to use this, right? Based on the sector of your destiny, but there are other ways too. Okay. This is the first one. 

I think it is easy. So let's talk about the first one. It's called asking your own deity about, and for advice, right? So you can go into this, finding a good time, or even if you don't have good time, you can still ask the deity, right? You go into a state of, you know, light meditation. 

Light meditation, we call this the alpha brainwaves, or I like to call it sage mode. That means like all the sages go into meditation, you break down your, slow down your brainwaves into a point where it's only, it's slower. You enter into a meditative, intuitive energy framework. 

So in that time, it's easier for you to set out a command, receive thoughts, and receive guidance. So generally what you're doing now is you're talking to your subconscious, or you, in scientific ways, you talk to the subconscious, or in a metaphysics way, you're talking to your guardian of destiny. So you can ask your guardian of destiny about a question, right? And maybe something you need guidance of, or you're not clear about this. 

I need some clarity on this. What should I do? Right? I need to know a little bit more about this. I'm unsure about that. 

Can you give me some guidance about this? Can you help me with this? Can you help me with that? Can you show me the way for this? Stuff like that, okay? So there are very simple type of clarifying questions, okay? Now, this is not a kindergarten class, I'm pretty sure you know how to ask clarifying questions, all right? Clarify some things, help me understand some things, show me the way for this, show me the way for that, right? I need to understand this better. What do I want? What do I not want? What is the beneficial path forward? What do I need to do right now? So many things you can do, okay? So you could write this down like so. If it's related to something to do with your career, this is a way you can ask the question, right? The simple way, right? You can see it's just two sentences, because you want to go down into meditation and ask the, and you address your guardian deity, hey Surgeon Snake, I need some clarification on this matter.

What do you think is the best way I handle this? Or what should I know about this that I don't already know? What can give me clarity on this subject matter? So you back direction and ask. Now, if you're doing this on your own, it's best to wait about seven days after you ask to wait for subconsciously the universe to give you the answer, okay? About within the seven, you cannot ask the next day answer, because you don't have that sort of a high level access yet, okay? So sometimes it takes a bit of time. It's like you call a long lost friend, right? Hey, you know, Surgeon Snake, can you give me this? It's like, hey, when was the last time you talked to the Surgeon Snake? 25 years ago? My God, even this friend doesn't remember you remember the friend, right? So you got to first build relationship, ask more questions, give a couple of days.

In seven days time, you know, if you didn't really get an answer, then ask again, that sort of thing, okay? Now, you could do it your way. Or you can do the simple way. How many of you would like a more simpler way? Simpler way, right? Okay, I have actually prepared an access for you right now for you to try this out. 

This is called the Oracle. And it really is based on the Oracle of the hour. So first, you need to determine where your destiny palace is.

Because then after that, when you know where your destiny palace is, and you determine there are good stars that enter the destiny palace, for example, in this case here, and on that day, you can access this thing called the Oracle. So here's the Oracle. You access this Oracle, hold on a second, I'll show you how you can get access to Oracle and try it out. 

This is for trial only. Or you can do it manually. I just taught you how to do manually.

I'm just showing you a slightly easier way to do it. So you're backing towards your direction. And now you take out your phone, because you can access it in your phone. 

And you're going to key in your question in detail. What do you need clarity on? Career? Wealth? What do you need to clarify on that you need to gain clarity on? Now, you can do it the manual way, the seven steps I told you about. Or you can actually do by asking a question. 

Hey, you know, I have this thing, I have this trouble. I'm concerned about this. I need clarity on this. 

I'm not sure if I should do that or this. What do I need to know in order to gain clarity? Ask in detail. You type the answer after you meditate with that. 

You type the question, you click, and the Oracle will be based on this current hour minutes chart. And now you're backing, you're using the physical together with the chart interpretation. And through my voice, this entire system that we have AI will help you generate the answer. 

It's really close to what I would say, because it's based on so many years of how I give advice to people. And now you could synthesize the whole thing and put a structure to it. And so you should test this out. 

Okay, this is really, really, really cool. And it will give you an answer like very close to what I would say based on the interpretation of the chart. And this is a short thing about what clarification you need. 

It's not the full forecast. It is a Oracle sort of thing to give you a short advice. But sometimes it's that one spark that you need, right? Okay, so you try this out. 

Now, how do you get there? So this here is part of the tribe plus that we give to all our tribe plus members, then they get to use it all the time. Now I just show you how to use it. But here's a trial for you a whole month for free. 

So you can use this throughout your month and get whatever clarity you need. Listen, you don't need clarity for every single day for 365 days, right? Maybe this one month, use it as many times as you want to get as much clarity as possible. But if you feel that this is valuable for you, then just keep being in there. 

If not, just end it, right? So try this out. No loss to you, only gains. All right. 

So to do this, you access this. This is a free trial claim to the tribe plus account. So at least now you get one month. 

If you're not already a tribe plus member, try this out. Because everyone at the start of their membership gets a welcome free one month just to try it out. So you're already in it, you're already in it, right? So just keep using it and do that and get the answer. 

But the difference is you're now using with your Chimon direction. So you're going to go into your Sage mode, talk to your guardian of destiny, and then type the question, see the answer. Okay, that's one way to gain some clarity. 

Okay, that's the first step. Everyone okay? All cool? Now inside the tribe plus, there's a lot of stuff. I want you to explore it yourself as well. 

Okay, you get a free month to gain access to everything. There is a monthly report based on your personal chart. And in that monthly report, it gives you the key highlights, you know, what to watch out for, what are important key areas of focus, how do you transform, how you stay aligned with clarity. 

It's all personalized by the way. Super personalized, it identifies areas where you need to focus, where you put your energy to, right? Your areas where good for communications, relationship, I mean, you just look at it, right? Get your chart, and you see how valuable the information is very, very personalized. With technology today, it's as close to 90 plus percent as if a person actually doing this whole thing manually for you. 

It's all there. And it tells you the best time to do things as well. It also has the recommendations on, you know, how do you balance your emotions? How do you manage your emotions? How do you look for the best period of time to take certain types of action? And it tells you how to manage your well-being, right? How to boost vitality. 

It gives you good dates as well. Okay, and all the good dates, you can use that for manifesting and or you use it for important activities. Anyway, I leave it up to you to explore, all right? There's a lot of things.

Okay, now, the Chairman Oracle is part of the features that are in there. The feature, one of the features is this Chairman Oracle. A lot of people didn't know it's there, who are in TriPlus, now you know. 

So go and access and have a look, okay? Now, the first part is, as I said, the spiritual achievement, asking for advice. The second part is co-creating destiny. So to co-create destiny, while you could use certain dates and time to manifest outcomes, but before you manifest, you have to do one type of exercise, and that is cleansing. 

If you don't do cleansing, no manifesting will work in the way you want it to work. It's kind of like, I'll show you this, right? This is a beautiful cup, yes? A glass. What if I pee in this glass right now? I mean, imagine, right? This yellow liquid is pee. 

And I put in the best Coca-Cola soda inside, put the best whiskey inside, I put in the best vodka shot inside, make the best cocktail ever, and have you drink this. You're still drinking pee, even with the best type of drinks inside, the best whiskey, the best drinks inside. Why? Because there's pee in the first place, yes or no? I know it is very descriptive, but you kind of get the answer, right? So the first step is, you need to, what do you need to do? You need to pour away the pee.

Not only that, you need to wash the freaking cup, yes or no? Or the glass. For some of you, even washing this glass with the most powerful cleaner, you still feel that it is not purified now, yes or no? Okay? So now imagine you are trying to do manifesting. And there's a lot of this negative energy inside, just like the pee that is inside. 

And you're trying to put the good stuff on it, the right achievement portal charts, the energy and all this stuff inside. At the end of the day, it's still shit. That part requires you to do cleansing and purifying exercises.

First, you need to clear. And when you clear this, when you finally clear out the energy, that is when the subsequent part where you install the new intentions and the commands, that's when you will get the true essence of manifesting. Okay? So write this down, cleansing first, manifesting later. 

And cleansing must happen as often as possible, once a year at least for those established practitioners, or at least like four to five times, you need to cleanse this. It's like a detox of your energy framework. How many of you agree with this type of one? Okay? Some of you guys follow me to China on China excursion or Taiwan excursion, we do cleansing exercises. 

Usually the first day we do a lot of that purifying first. Because once you do that, the next part of manifesting becomes easy. Okay. 

All right. Having said that, I'm going to give you the dates for cleansing, and I will also give you the commands for cleansing verbally when you're doing the cleansing. All right. 

Are you ready for it? So here it is. This is for the next two days. And I need you to pay attention to this exactly how it is done. 

Okay. Now, this is not like the best of the best of the best cleansing dates, but it is best for now, because we need to use this for the next, in this four-part training. Right? So to get, to give you the best chance of being able to manifest something significant by the end of this four-part training, you first have to do this exercise. 

Okay. Assuming that you have some, as we say, pee water in the glass, or even if you don't have pee inside the glass, the glass is still stained. Right? So you're going to do that washing, that spiritual cleansing. 

So here are the dates. The first one is, this is on your local time, guys. It's going to be based on your, wherever you are in the world. 

The first one is, in fact, tomorrow morning, 23rd of October. 23rd of October, 2025. And the timing is between 5am to 7am. 

Now you don't need to do this for an entire hour. I don't know. You don't have that many things to cleanse, right? You can do it around 6.30, 6.45 is the usual time. 

A lot of people get up to go to work. Okay. So you find the southeast sector of your home. 

Okay. The southeast region of your home. It can be anywhere in the southeast. 

So this is a home, right? The entire quadrant here is the southeast. So it can be from center all the way to that area. Find the southeast region of your home.

Anywhere within that region of your home, the region of that home, you're going to go to that area. And on that area, the zone, right? The southeast area zone, the 6.30, okay? You don't have to go into someone else's room. You can just be on the outside, that area. 

And you're going to sit down in a comfortable way with your back, back towards your own Cheeman Destiny Palace direction. I repeat, at 6, between 5 to 7am, go to the southeast area of your home, 23rd of October, local time. Back toward your, any direction, right? Back toward your Cheeman Destiny direction.

And on that time, I would like you to play a voice-led cleansing instruction that I will lead you through. Just follow, just listen. All you do is click play, put down, and listen. 

And you do that, okay? You will do this very, very simple exercise, all right? Super, super simple exercise to go through that cleansing thing. I will lead you through utilizing the 7-Star Chief, which is what we use for cleansing all the time. And on the 23rd, if you look at the chart, there's the Void Constellation, which is perfect for taking all the burdens and pain and everything that is unfair to you in this life and all the blockage and sending it into the void.

Okay? Now, for some people, obviously, you're listening to this as a replay and you probably missed it and all that. I don't know whether I'm including this in the replay or not, but we'll see, okay? So, there is a second date and time, not as good as the first date because we always like Void together with Chief 7-Star level, which is obviously the highest form, most purest form of Chief, and Void Constellation is perfect. The second one, which is also Chief at the 7-Star level, and it has a Net Constellation, which is part of the Moon Constellation, because in constellations, there are five elements plus sun and moon. 

So, moon is pretty good at, you know, doing a yin, re-calibration and so forth. So, this would be on the 24th of October, just a day later, between 3 to 5 p.m. 3 to 5 p.m. Okay? So, 3 to 5 p.m., this is the monkey hour, and you're going to go to the west area of your home. Now, I know this is probably a workday or you're somewhere else, then go to the west area of your office or your studio or wherever you are, right? The west area. 

Just close your eyes for a time period, put in your sound, what do you call that, noise cancellation, AirPod 3 earphones, right? Plug it in, and then, you know, at the right moment, once you calm down, relax, you click on my voice message, which I will send to you around that time, about 3.30 p.m. Okay? 3.30 p.m. around that time, because anywhere between the time, local time, right? So, once you have that, you're going to use that to do the cleansing. You're going to send all the negative energy with the assistance of the chief and your own achievement guardian of destiny, and all the way, the net constellation will catch it and send it away. Okay? Do that. 

Can you do that? This is very important. If you have been betrayed before, you have any pain, anything you wish that, you know, do you want to let go, anything that's traumatized you before, you want to get to this sector, and then turn backing towards your achievement destiny direction. So, you want to physically be in the west area on the 24th at between 3 to 5, and turning around so that your back is faced towards, back towards your achievement destiny direction. 

That is the instruction, okay? It cannot be any more simpler than this. Okay? Okay. Now, so now you know what to do for tomorrow morning. 

I know it's getting quite late for those who are watching live right now. Remember I said that for you guys who stayed to the end, there'll be a chance for you, if you're watching this live, to win this, the Deity's book. How many of you would like to win this? Yeah? Okay. 

So, there is an exercise for you to do, and after you complete the exercise, you need to post it onto our Facebook group. Okay? Because when you post it there, it shows that you've done your work, and your work will also inspire others. You create good karma, good energy. 

You benefit, everyone benefits. It's a good thing. All right? And this is like an ethical bribe. 

I shouldn't have to be bribing you to do your homework. I mean, you go to school those days, your teacher don't bribe you, right? But here I am trying to encourage you to do something. So, here's the thing. 

Okay? So, there'll be three books I'm going to give away. The rest, if you don't win it, you can buy it. You do this exercise, and if you submitted the best three answers, the best three people who did this, we will announce the winners and send a copy to you. 

Okay? We'll get your address and send to you. How about that? Okay? Let's try. Do your homework. 

It's good for you. So, here's the thing. This is called the Divine Manifesting Clarity and Intention Activation Challenge. 

So, there's a couple of questions here in this document, and you need to fill this up to the best of your ability. So, you're going to sit with your back toward your destiny, palace direction, getting to that stage by calming down your mind, right? Getting into that stillness, meditate a little bit. The way to do that is to slow down your breathing, count backwards, 64 to one. 

Okay? If you count backwards slowly from 64 to one, you're in the zone. It's actually that easy. Okay? You don't have to go into deep trance, and then you see angels and all that. 

No, I think that you already go to heaven, yeah? No need to think anymore. So, you need to just go to a little bit, slow down your brain waves. From 64, you count backwards, concentrate on the numbers. 

Just concentrate. Don't think about anything else except for counting backwards. That's all you need to do while sitting with your back towards the direction. 

And when you're there, after you reach to point number one at zero, you open your eyes and you go through this. Name your sacred desire. What outcome is your soul truly calling in right now? Declare it as if it already exists and write why it feels sacred, holy, urgent, inevitable for you to create it now. 

Why is it important in other words? Write it down. And then you're going to be very, very, very open about this. You're going to talk about, you know, face the cost of delay. 

Suppose if this desire or this manifesting goal never actually manifests in the end, what will remain missing in your, let's say, relationships, your career, your finance, your goals in life, your freedom, your impact? I mean, you want to answer this question. How has this affected? You haven't got this yet, right? Because that's why you're trying to manifest it. How has this affected your life so far? Like really tell the truth. 

Because truth has power. Okay. And have you gotten used to not having this? Used to being average? That, you know, now you're thinking that not having it has become normal.

Maybe that's the problem. That's a cost, you know? Remember the moment you don't claim your greatness, you won't get it. And, you know, who else will feel the weight of your unfulfilled potential? I mean, when you're not fulfilling this potential or manifesting it, will your wife, you know, won't get the life that she deserved for marrying you? Or like, will your parents be proud of you if you don't achieve this? Or they'll just be all right. 

I mean, know that you're kind of not able to do it anyway, right? Or how much longer are you willing to live in this, this lack environment, right? I mean, lack of other words, this loser environment. How long? Right? But I'm not a loser. Fine. 

You're not saying you are. You're saying if you continue to not have this, right? Are you okay with being a loser? That's what you internally need to say. Because you see, change happens when you say enough is enough, right? What the world says is not important. 

What you say to you is important. Okay. The third thing is, now I need you to embody the vision. 

Now you can meditate on this, right? And step into the reality where this desire is already alive. What is that reality to you? How does it look, feel, and shift the way, you know, your day, the way you talk to people, the way you connect to others, the way you relate to others. I want you to capture all the details that is electrifying your spirit and, you know, that you know that this is already yours. 

Now you need to write this down. Remember I say, there's a power in writing things down. This is the part. 

Okay. Let your emotions flow. Write it down. 

I mean, there's no loss in writing this. Now, number four is, I need you to be very clear on this. Okay. 

Remember you are in that sage mode now. You're going to call out the shadows, what the true fears are, what the doubts really are, what are the hidden attachment that is really pulling you back. Okay. 

You want to write them down so that they are whole over you dissolves and, you know, all this negative will dissolve in the light of your awareness. Remember that. So I want you to write this down. 

Okay. It's part of the homework, right? And then the fifth part is, I need you to summon your divine allies. Which are the deities that you think, even though they're not your deity, right? Chief, snake, tortoise, which one, right? And what type of practices or energies that you can align with that can help you with this vision? As in which divine deity achievement do you think can assist you? So you're going to call this deity out and say, Hey, Sergei snake, you're on. 

I need you to help do this. You're going to get this done for me. Okay. 

So which deity? And then number six is you need to seal your intention with action. So you need to plan what's the next bold action you would take to show within the next 24 hours that you're ready to say to this universe that, you know, I'm ready to receive this stuff. Remember the part to conquer? This is the part. 

So really I'm putting you through the exercise. Okay. Some of you are saying, Oh, you don't know all the details about the deities. 

Well, it's in this book. That's why you're doing this. I'll give it to you. 

There are some short videos that I filmed that are under the resource section. So, um, it's before we started this training is already there, but most will miss it. You can actually, can you just put up the link in a shot? Yeah. 

Okay. These are the short descriptions of the deities that you can log on to have a look. If you want a bit more information, uh, do I have to do it on the good hour? Yes, you can do it on a good hour. 

Uh, that, the, the cleansing hour, you can use the cleansing hour, or you can do it at any hour because the cleansing is for cleansing is for that. Um, cleansing, uh, achievement ritual that bring you through some, it's not a religious ritual. It is a cleansing ritual, a format, a formula for you to remove the negative energy. 

But at the same hour, you can also do this exercise if you'd like to, or you can do it any time of day. Okay. When you're ready, then I want you to scan this code or at least take down this page for us. 

It's actually the achievement, uh, page on our, our, um, achievement group. And I want you to submit that homework in there, right? Clearly, please. Okay. 

And then we'll select three winners. Easy. Okay. 

All right. All right. Be sure to submit. 

Yeah. And, um, those of you on goal pass, right? So the goal pass, you guys need to, uh, there's a Q and a specifically for you guys by our team that, uh, they're logging on. I think tomorrow or day after you got to check, right? They have a session just to answer your questions. 

Okay. So you want to log on there. It's live. 

We can answer the, we can help you out with some of the questions you might have. The team will be there. Okay. 

Log onto your dashboard and check that out. Um, and, uh, for just a quick announcement here for some of you, I know you're an advanced user or achievement. Okay. 

This four part is generally for the beginners who just getting started and learning, right? So if you're a super advanced practitioner or achievement, and you want the next thing up, then the right place to go is here. Okay. You go to, if you're looking for an advanced program in achievement, we do have an advanced training in achievement.

Okay. So go there and get all the information that you need now. Okay. 

So that's it for our part one. Make sure you do your homework, but here's the thing. Don't, don't go over here.

And I will tell you something. Hold on. Chill, chill, chill, chill. 

Okay. Okay. All right, guys, hold on a second before you go before you go. 

Um, I know some of you might have some questions here that you want me to answer. Uh, and, uh, I can do that. If you just give me about maybe 10 minutes or so refreshing up, I'll go to my other room here and log on telegram.

Okay. I'll log on telegram. This is also to encourage you to be on our telegram channel.

And I will turn on, and I really enjoy this because I can just talk and feel really relaxed. And, um, I will turn on my telegram live stream. Everyone here log on to the telegram.

So it's not that hard to do so. And don't have all this negative thinking. Oh, you know, I couldn't do this. 

It's not good. Just, just download it. Okay. 

Uh, and, and then, uh, click onto the group, the, the, this group. And then I, when I go live, just click join, right? Then I will talk to you and you can ask me questions. Uh, make sure your mic is, uh, on.
