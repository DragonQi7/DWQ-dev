## Introduction & purpose

This session is Part 1 of a four-part training intended to introduce Qimen (Qimen Dunjia) and the practical, time-dimensional approach to manifesting outcomes in life (wealth, health, relationships, influence, freedom).

Key opening lines (verbatim / preserved tone):

> "Welcome to the Cheeman Manifesting Framework. There's going to be a four-part training on mastering the art of Cheeman Manifesting without the guesswork... we're going to turn your desire into wealth for love, for influence and freedom at your command."

The teacher frames the system as practical and structured — not mere positive thinking — with the emphasis on timing (portals) + clear commands + personal alignment.

## What Qimen Dunjia is (plain-language)

- Qimen Dunjia = "mystical doors / hiding armor" → portals to alternate outcomes.
- It's part of the Three Oracles in classical Chinese metaphysics; compared to Dr. Strange's portals: you find the portal that leads to the reality where your desired outcome already exists.
- Distinguishing feature: uses time-dimensional energies (year/month/day/hour charts) to find the best portal to co-create outcomes.

Verbatim framing:

> "Qimen Dunjia is the ability to manifest and bend reality... you have to train your ability to actually find these portals, okay?"

## Achievement systems overview (four core + four subsystems)

Teacher groups applied Qimen into four primary models (core powers):

1. Achievement forecasting — see possible outcomes (like Dr. Strange scanning futures).
2. Achievement destiny — discover innate abilities and spiritual strengths.
3. Achievement Feng Shui — read environmental energy and best positions.
4. Achievement strategic execution — the tactical steps to win.

Four supporting subsystems: intuitive intelligence, oracle (guidance), and a specialized "Warcraft" model for large-scale / competitive business outcomes.

Purpose: pick the right model for your goal (e.g., small tactical choices use oracle/day-hour charts; big transformations use month/year planning).

## Guardian of Destiny — the 10 frequencies (short profiles)

The instructor explains that each person is born with a lifetime "guardian of destiny" (10 possible frequencies). They are not literal gods but energetic archetypes (frequency channels). Key profiles (condensed):

- Chief — wish-fulfilling, strong protection; grants what you ask but can over-protect.
- Nine Heavens — imagination & visualization; helps visual manifestors.
- Nine Earth — accumulation & healing; assets and restorative power.
- Great Moon — knowledge, downloads, learning; good for discovering missing domain knowledge.
- Six Harmony — people & connection; opens relational influence and likability.
- Black Tortoise — mind-reading/psychic influence; strong empathy and influence (can feel others' pain).
- White Tiger — stamina, endurance, high energy (can be excess if unchannelled).
- Surging Snake — environment / trend-sensing / wizardry for changing conditions.
- Red Phoenix — power of speech; words carry strong creative force.
- Hook — karmic ties, memory/recalling past life lessons; access to larger time chapters.

Instructor reminder: these are energetic frequencies; they're neither religious nor require worship. They're usable frameworks for practice and alignment.

## Common manifesting pitfalls

- Unconscious manifesting: sending instructions you don't intend (e.g., overprotection leads to stagnation).
- Self-sabotage: lack of clarity, low self-worth, fear of charging high prices or taking bold actions.
- Misaligned desire: wanting something outside your current realm of possibility without a step plan.
- Begging / wishing language: avoid hope/ask/plead phrasing — use commanding, equivalent-exchange, and sealing language.

Verbatim highlight:

> "When all four realms are aligned, all manifestations become reality." — alignment across spirit / heaven / earth / human is required.

## The Qimen manifesting framework (practical five-step)

The teacher summarizes a compact framework you will use across the four parts:

1) Intent — define crystal-clear desire (worth your time, within realm of possibility, specific, timeframe).
2) Align — match spirit, heaven, earth and human realms; choose the portal/time-chart that supports your palace.
3) Command — issue clear, secure, sealed instructions (no begging language; include equivalent exchange).
4) Conquer — take your part (action plan; immediate bold next step within 24 hours is required).
5) Validate — record signs, evidence, and gratitude; track wins and signals from the oracle/universe.

Teacher analogy (verbatim-like): placing an order on food-delivery: set intent (order), align/time, command/pay, conquer/prepare table, validate/receive and check.

## Practical mechanics: charts, portals, timing, cleansing

- Charts: destiny (birth) chart is the baseline; month/day/hour charts are dynamic overlays. Use day/hour for tactical activations; month/year for longer outcomes.
- Realms on the chart: spirit (inspiration), heaven (thoughts), earth (doors/doors), human (actions/results). Use overlaps to find portals opening to your palace.
- Portal rule: pick the star/door/constellation that matches the life area (palace) you want to affect; use day or hour charts (hour = faster, more precise).
- Cleansing first: remove energetic blockages before installing new commands. Analogy in text: clean the cup before pouring a fine drink.

Verbatim instruction (core principle):

> "Cleansing first, manifesting later."

## Homework & cleansing instructions (practical steps from the session)

The teacher gave an actionable homework / activation protocol to be used during this four-part training.

Primary clarity exercise (short):

1. Identify the life area you want clarity on (career, wealth, relationship, health).
2. Sit with your back toward your Destiny Palace direction (from your destiny chart) and enter a sage/alpha state (calm breath or count backwards 64→1).
3. Reflect & observe: what history, actions, thoughts, and feelings relate to this area? Write them down (no judgment).
4. Articulate the desired outcome in your own words (specific, why it's sacred, timeframe).
5. List shadows/fears and what you will do in the next 24 hours (an immediate bold action) to show commitment.

Cleansing dates (as taught; local time):

- 23 Oct 2025, between 05:00–07:00 — go to the southeast sector of your home, back toward your destiny palace; play the voice-led cleansing (teacher will lead) and follow.
- 24 Oct 2025, between 15:00–17:00 — go to the west sector (or appropriate workspace), back toward destiny palace; use the second guided cleansing (chief + net constellation assistance).

The teacher emphasizes: if missed live, follow instructions locally (same sectors/hours) and do the guided audio when available. Post homework to the group for accountability and prize draws.

## Short checklist: next actions (copy and paste)

- [ ] Sit with back to destiny palace and complete the clarity activation (count 64→1, write intent + cost of delay).
- [ ] Schedule and perform the guided cleansing (local time; 23 Oct morning + 24 Oct afternoon as instructed) or do the nearest suitable clean window.
- [ ] Write one bold action to take in the next 24 hours (Conquer) and do it.
- [ ] Log the validations (evidence, synchronicities, gratitude) daily for the training period.

If you'd like I can:

1) Append the full raw transcript as an appendix to this file.
2) Produce a 1-page "Perfect Command" cheat-sheet (fillable) and save it under `TRANSCRIPTION Library/QIMEN Manifesting/cheatsheets/`.
3) Generate a compact protocol table mapping the 10 frequencies → suggested constellations → quick-use tasks for common goals.
