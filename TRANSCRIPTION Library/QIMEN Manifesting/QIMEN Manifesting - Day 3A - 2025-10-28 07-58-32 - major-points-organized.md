## Opening & context

This file preserves verbatim excerpts and organizes major points from the Day 3A session. The instructor frames the day as "part three" of the Achievement Manifesting Framework with the focal lesson: how to structure the perfect command.

Key opening lines (verbatim):

> "So, this is the part three, in case you've missed, right, this is the part three of our Manifesting Framework, Achievement Manifesting Framework. And I want to pick some of the more common questions here to start the day, to warm up before we go on to the core of our training today, which is about the perfect command."

> "Well, you got a glimpse of it. ... And so, today, we're going to focus on how do you actually structure the perfect command? So, there is a huge difference, there's a huge difference between praying and manifesting. Okay? Huge difference."

---

## FAQ — Common questions (verbatim excerpts)

The instructor addresses many frequently asked questions early in the session. The following are verbatim excerpts grouped by question.

- Can I use other deities (not my Garden of Destiny)?

> "The answer is absolutely yes, eventually. Eventually. ... Get to know your Garden of Destiny first. Get a feel of it. Right, guys? You understand what I'm talking about? I mean, if you resonate with me. You get connected first by asking for small things. Okay? Asking for smaller things, like something for tomorrow, or day after, a small little favor. Right? Connect with that first."

- Can Qimen tell me / predict if I'll ever be successful?

> "Qimen is not a fortune-telling system, if you will, right? But if you use Qimen on a strategic level, you will be successful eventually, or even in the next couple of months or years. Because in Qimen, you are engineering and co-creating your destiny."

- Do I have to meditate or be super spiritual to make this work?

> "The answer is no. There are no mantras. There are no prayers or, you know, very elaborate spiritual rituals and chanting that you need to do. In fact, you shouldn't. ... The idea is not about that. The idea is for you to, you yourself, have that enlightenment. When you achieve that, you see things for what they are and you become better and you can take from the invisible world and manifest it into the external world..." 

- What if I don't resonate with my guardian deity at all?

> "At first, at first. Okay? The reason is because all these years, you have never contacted this guardian angel. Never. It's always been there. So, after a while... give yourself about two to three months, you will resonate 100% with the guardian of destiny." 

- Does having a weaker one- or two-star guardian deity mean I'm at a disadvantage?

> "The answer is no. It's not. Each of this level, it's called spiritual alignment, each of this level have a different type of frequency. ... zero is so powerful that it cannot be divided nor multiplied. It is an absolute number."

- Can intuition be trained?

> "Intuition can be trained. Okay? In fact, the level six star in your achievement, I'll tell you guys, don't get so excited yet, right, as we go through the topics today, level six actually talks about intuition. Okay? So, it actually can be trained. It can be developed." 

- How do I know if my deity has heard me?

> "Sense of knowing, some people... look for evidential occurrences. And evidential occurrences in our modern day language are signs from the universe. ... A reply only makes sense if you understood what was the question. Otherwise, it's basically the universe spamming you."

## Perception — Prayer vs Manifesting (story + lessons)

The instructor strongly distinguishes praying (coming from lack) versus commanding (anticipation and preparation). The rain story is used as the primary metaphor.

Verbatim retelling of the rain story (important passage):

> "So one day the head of the village fell really ill. No water to drink, right? So he couldn't attend the prayer ceremony so he asked his young daughter to go in his place... The young daughter said, okay, I'll do it. ... she was actually carrying an umbrella and several empty buckets. ... While all these adults did the whole ceremony, ... what did the little girl do? The little girl carefully opened up her umbrella and placed her buckets all around her, right? And then she lifted her face to the sky and just waited. And within minutes, the wind began to stir. The sky darkened, heavy clouds gathered above and soon, thunder rolled across the valleys and rain began to pour... The villagers gasped... the little girl laughed and danced in the downpour, collecting the precious water in all her carefully prepared buckets."

Key lesson (verbatim bite):

> "When you wish for something, you acknowledge the absence of, write that down, this is a lesson here, very important, okay? When you wish for something, you acknowledge the absence of, but when you command something with calm certainty, and you're preparing as if it's already coming, you align with the vibrations of having it and that's when the rain will come..." 

Short summary: prepare the space as if the desired outcome is already arriving (anticipation), and combine that with right timing/direction.

## The Gap, Urgency & The Law of Equivalent Exchange

The instructor repeatedly returns to concrete framing: define the gap, put numbers/dollar value on it, create urgency, and be willing to pay an equivalent price (time, energy, money) — this secures the command.

Verbatim highlights:

> "What's the gap between where you are and where you want to be?... If you put a dollar sign to it, it's quite, I mean, now, the reason I say this is because the perfect command that you're about to learn today relates a lot to closing this gap. If you don't know this gap, you can't specifically manifest the outcome."

> "The law of equivalent exchange always says energy exchanges. You gotta give something to get something. Not always money, but money is a good way to measure this. Sometimes your energy, your time. ... So, what's the maximum you'd invest to closing that gap for yourself? Put a dollar sign to it." 

Actionable note: when writing a command, include what you commit to give in return — this secures the exchange.

## Eight Spiritual Alignments — quick overview (verbatim + paraphrase)

The instructor maps eight alignments (level 1 → level 0) and associates each level with lessons and pitfalls. Short verbatim fragments follow; these are preserved for accuracy.

> "Level one talks about survival energy... Level two is about desire energy... level three, for example, powers to do with leadership and conquering... zero is one of the, it can be the biggest number. It can also be the smallest number. It encompasses everything."

Paraphrase summary (organizer):

- Level 1: Survival — tendency: fear; spiritual lesson: choose internal safety/trust.
- Level 2: Desire — tendency: chronic wanting; lesson: embody and pair with action.
- Level 3: Power — tendency: control/willpower; lesson: learn to receive and ease.
- Level 4: Connection — tendency: over-giving/people-pleasing; lesson: energetic boundaries.
- Level 5: Growth — tendency: perpetual student; lesson: practice completion and celebration.
- Level 6: Intuition — tendency: drift or bypassing; lesson: anchor intuition in action.
- Level 7: Soul/transcendent — tendency: detachment/superiority; lesson: embodiment and service.
- Level 0 (Tao): Nothingness / everything — tendency: loss of motivation; lesson: re-engage with play and purpose.

Note: the instructor maps these to palaces in an achievement destiny chart (destiny palace, wealth palace, etc.) and to practical timing.

## Three ways to amplify your universal command (verbatim + notes)

The instructor gives three complementary techniques to amplify/align the command. Verbatim summaries and notes follow.

1) Star levels (use chiefs / deity star levels in day/hour charts)

> "By looking at these star levels... for beginners, use day chart. And when you're more advanced, use hour chart. ... So now when you issue a command for manifesting wealth, your chances of success is very high because the energies align with your wealth palace and you are commanding or manifesting an outcome that is related to wealth."

Note: overlay your destiny palace with the day chart — if a high-level chief enters your target palace, it's an excellent day to command that subject.

2) The 28 constellations (green dragon group is especially favourable)

> "The green dragon group ... these seven of them really facilitates your wish fulfilling. Almost all creation that you want to manifest, that you want to command for a certain reality to come, using any of these seven usually gets you the outcome. ... Horn is great for it."

3) Special Qimen Structures (formations / patterns)

> "Special Qimen Structures such as ... Qing Long Fan Shao (Green Dragon Returns), Fei Liu Tit Yue (Flying Bird), Yuk Lui Sau Mun (Jade Maiden Guarding the Door) — these are among the Sam Po (Three Precious) formations. ... Other formations include double deception, nobility deception, Empyrean force, terrestrial force, mortal force, dragon force, tiger force ..." 

Note: the instructor describes both the "hard way" (plot charts by stems/branches) and the "easy"/software way (Achievement Explorer's Structures/Strategies function) to find dates/hours with those formations.

## The Five Steps to the Perfect Command (core lesson)

The instructor distills the perfect command flow into five steps. Verbatim sequence and guidance below.

> "There are five steps to this ready? ... the first one is activate define amplify secure and seal five steps to activate means you need to open up the connection... number two is when you define and program the reality that you want... and then you need to amplify it a little bit... and then you gotta lock in the energies... and finally you need to close the energy field and claim the completion so it's a five step process."

Short guide for each step (organizer):

1. Activate — open the connection; summon deity energies and constellations; do not plead or beg; use commanding language ("I command", "I activate").
2. Define — program the desired reality precisely (what, who, timing, how it will look/feel), avoiding vague lack-focused phrasing.
3. Amplify — expand the intention but avoid trying to control the exact "how"; allow the universe to orchestrate the means.
4. Secure — invoke the law of equivalent exchange; specify what you're willing to give (time, money, service, resources) and create a reciprocal commitment.
5. Seal — close and ground the command with authoritative language, avoid premature gratitude that dilutes authority.

Verbatim dos & don'ts (key lines):

> "Never say please or I hope. Don't say the word please. Don't say the word I hope. ... You must remember that so focusing on lack will always keep lack active so you cannot define it that way." 

> "Gratitude before commission dilutes authority... So what you're trying to say is basically you affirm it right you have positive anticipation moving forward by awakening to the new that's what you need to do."

## Examples: bad vs strong command (preserved)

Bad (verbatim example from the session):

> "I really hope the universe and the chief deity can help me attract money soon please give me money things have been slow and I'm getting tired of struggling please let some good opportunities show up for me maybe a new client or someone who wish to invest in my business I'm open to anything that will make my life easier and help me earn what I deserve I know abundance is possible for me if it's meant to be maybe the universe will bless my efforts and remove any blocks that are stopping me from being successful thank you universe for all the blessings that are coming my way thank you"

Instructor: "you will get nothing out of this it's not a command it's just a wish"

Strong (organizer / paraphrase of instructor's improved command):

> "I command the chief to mobilize all forces of prosperity and expansion within my field. Leadership clarity and decisive moment awaken in me now. I command and activate the void constellation, the basket constellation, the heart constellation. Every opportunity that builds my wealth reveals itself with precision and timing, perfect in my favor. Ideas shall translate into strong results and actions. Attract aligned partnerships and profitable outcomes as of now. My influence expands naturally... Make all income streams grow consistent, compounding and reliable wealth anchors firmly under my command supporting freedom, stability and my family's comfort. In return, I will do more for society and expand opportunities for others. I fully command this creation and what I said is active and expanding; this reality is grounded and prosperous and complete. And so it is."

Note: the above strong example preserves wording and the five-step structure: activation, definition, amplification, securing via equivalent exchange, and sealing.

## Notes & next steps

- This file preserves core verbatim passages and an organized outline. If you want a fully literal transcript (no organization), I can add the raw transcript as an appendixed verbatim block.
- Next step recommended: create a short "how to write your perfect command" cheat-sheet (one-page) that students can copy/paste and fill with their own gap and equivalent exchange values. I can create that and save it under `TRANSCRIPTION Library/QIMEN Manifesting/cheatsheets/`.

---

If you'd like me to: (select one)

1. Save a full raw verbatim transcript appended to this file. (yes/no)
2. Create a one-page fillable cheat-sheet for writing a command (I can create and save it). (yes/no)
3. Mark this Day 3A task complete and add a short commit message in the repo (I will update the repo todo). (already queued)
