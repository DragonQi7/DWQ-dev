## Introduction & Foundation
> "Welcome, welcome to your Saturday with Grand Master Liu. Always stimulating, right? Gives us so much to think about."

> "So today is the last module, or last class of the first module, which is the lay down the foundation. So the foundation."

> "One is visible, one is invisible. So which means that we just talk about this class and the last class, yin and yang. So that is the most important concept."

## Universe, Consciousness & Purpose
> "At least today, at least today we know science, right? At least in modern science point of view, how much would you know? How much would we know? Modern science already proved we only know four percent of the entire universe. Only four percent of the universe."

> "The dial is before the big bang. You see the difference? You have to really see that before the big bang, something already there. Then the big bang is called the universal exist."

> "So when we look at that any event materialize, there's two things, events or matters, right? There's two things. One is events. One is the matters."

## Elements & System (why five elements)
> "Five element consciousness is a framework. The most profound framework, because they perform this. They bury everything what we learned into this framework."

> "In the first, this module, we try to build up this concept is that we have to know. There are many different ways that can learn this framework, many different ways that therefore many universities, many masters are there to teach, right?"

> "What is a Dao? We say that Dao is a Dao, then the Dao can manifest as the oneness, then the oneness can manifest two, which is yin and yang. The yin-yang can manifest many things, then the many things can be also expanded for everything."

## Wood element focus (tenderness, liver)
> "So the word element, one of the most important, it's not the element itself, it's the consciousness of the element. So consciousness of this element is a role, different, be flexible, right, can be bent, can be changed, can be changed, right."

> "So the wood element so important. Then therefore you put this wood element is between water and the fire, right? Look."

> "The other so important concept of the wood element which is the liver, this path, is the emotions. The qi, right? We say everything is the qi. We'll go back to one of the concepts."

## Qi, emotions & physiology
> "Life is the qi. What is qi? Qi is power, right? Power, information, consciousness, and the life source."

> "With the qi, you are alive. Without the qi, you are dead. You're just pieces of meat and the light down there."

> "So the qi is very important. So everything needs a qi. The liver qi is very important."

> "When the qi can change it, what happens? The blood can change. Yin and yang can change. If a qi can arise and the blood can arise, and then your blood pressure can arise. After rise at a certain level, suddenly you have no qi, then the blood stuck there cause the blood clog. Then if you stay at the, the blood stop at the wrong place, then stroke happens at the wrong place."

## Practice, homework & application
> "You need to really try to practice of the elements of the yin and yang, yin yang concept. You have to practice, you must. So this way will help you, at least help you to see things differently."

> "The other way to do the homework is real play your five fingers, truly understand. So simple concept. I'm telling you, because if you want to use this so naturally without the thinking, without the thinking, but you have to think you still need to think why sometimes you use the thumb, not index finger."

> "If you can do that, you are graduated. Then that's just new beginning."

## Q&A highlights (selected verbatim)
> "Thumb related to your lung, and the pinky related to your heart."

> "The middle finger is related to pericardium. The pericardium is the yang of the heart. The heart is in. The pericardium is yang. The real heart function is pericardium."

> "It's separated. Before, after, looking like they have a dot, and the zero. No, it's continuously and smoothly, and gradually... You cannot separate it. It is every moment we are dying. It's true."

> "The notes cannot cover. Now, your chi is what? It's your consciousness. So that's why go to the next level, become what kind of qigong practice will allow you open up this range... That takes a lot, a lot of years, practice, practice, and practice."

## Closing / final admonitions
> "You need to find that there's an access code. The access code has to come from your heart, not your mind. The access code has come from your heart. Not in your mind. Otherwise, every PhD can get it. Done."

> "Have a nice Saturday. Well, the rest of the day, I know I wouldn't screw up, you guys. The weekends and the beautiful weekends, enjoy the Saturday and the Sunday, discover your wisdoms."
