## Introduction / Foundation

> "this is a very exciting period where we start getting more into the five elements and the relationships."

> "we are finishing the first module which is the foundation."

> "So foundation is very important. The foundation will help you how high or how deep you want to go."

> "we say there's a foundation, foundation, foundation."

## Five-element framework & Xiangsheng ("mutual creation")

> "the framework includes the five elements. So when the five elements are put into that framework, then position, you have to understand it's called a position."

> "Each element has its own unique character, own chi, own consciousness, and own purpose."

> "This circle in the Chinese framework is called the first circle we have to see. Chinese called the Xiangsheng. That circle means Xiangsheng."

> "If you translate that to English, you would call it mutual creation."

> "It's called a mother-child relationship. So which means each one is the mother. Each one also can be the child."

## Mother–child relationship (energy flow)

> "The energy always is not high. I'm not saying mother's energy is high. That's not what I say. I'm saying that's always from the mother position, give it to the kids, give it to the child."

> "This one is unconditional, never change, never change."

> "The level of the mother will directly impact to the level of the child growth questions."

> "The mother's balance, mother's harmony, mother's wisdom will directly impact to the child will grow."

## Clinical examples & application

> "One number one killer in the clinic, we say heart disease... Always. It's not coming from the heart. It's coming from the stomach. The earth, stomach and the spleen is the child of the heart."

> "So the mother's level will directly impact the child. That's the second one."

> "For example, today, you know, many, many people experience chronic cough after COVID... You think it's a lung issue. You constantly treat the lung, but it's not. It's a mother. Digestive system function disorder."

> "We have to deal with the earth, digestive system, and the lung at the same time. We cannot just treat the lung without considering mother."

> "high blood pressure... can be emotions, which is a liver issue, but also high blood pressure can be a stachyne issue. You run out of gas, you run out of qi, you're so tired, what's happening? So we have to deal the liver and kidney at the same time."

## Oneness, qi, and practice

> "Once we go beyond the materialized, what do we see? We see the chief. We see the consciousness. We see the purpose."

> "If you want to discover deeply, or you say discover true, you will need the qi. Because the bottom line is the qi."

> "Qi is invisible. Elements are visible. Fire is visible. Water is visible. Earth I can make the cup is visible. Water I can drink is visible. But the qi of the water, the qi of the earth, that's invisible."

> "If you can have that experience without the mind and the qi can do something and can show you something, then you can jump from the concept of the qi become experience of the qi. The real qi."

## Q&A highlights (selected verbatim lines)

> "The father cannot create the baby. Father only raise the baby."

> "To use the medical Qigong for your mother to treatment is unnatural. Why is it unnatural? Because you give it to them. You force that. You try to force the Qi. Give it to her."

> "The natural itself is a much higher level because we cannot perform the natural healing. We perform the unnatural of the natural healing."

> "When my mother goes to sleep, I go to practice my Qigong. So I wish I can break this fears in unconsciousness level. She would be better because I am part of her life."

> "Oneness contain the yin and the yang."

> "The homework is that you guys have to use this concept and look at yourself and maybe look at the leather bed of your outside mother-child, whatever this kind of relationship, truly understand and maybe use a condition, use it this way. Dive deep, not a superficial level."
