Learning process (information → knowledge → system → wisdom)
- "The first level is grabbing or take information or data, whatever, how do you want to call it? It's information, right?"

Practical application & examples
- "I continuously use this concept, right? My master always say, you must follow this concept again and again."
- "For example, I, someone suffer in a chronic constipation, right?... Suppose I say, I'm going to use lung, lung as the, I will enter because the lung, the function is allow energy rise and energy drop. So the lung and the colon has a relationship."
- "That's just a different angle. Suppose they say, okay, I don't want this. How can I go to the water gate?... So the water element is important, right?"
- "You can take wood, you can take the metal, you can take the kidney water, make it the common, that's the teamwork."

Emphasis on levels and systems
- "System different, thinking different, combination different, then the outcome will be different. So that's why we say five element consciousness framework is levels."
- "So the second very important concept about the discourse, right? About the discourse. This course, how do we going to do that, right?"

- "The first homework is you need to realize what's called the quantum leap, the Wu."
- "Wu is you. You need Wu."

Process & practice guidance
- "Again and again means that you have to start for the consciousness mind, then turn to the unconsciousness mind. Then we will turn to no consciousness mind."
- "The wisdom cannot use language to pass, to teach. You have to experience."

Memory, imagery & healing

Modern-science parallels & big-picture metaphors
