So today, last week was Shang Chen, and this week we're gonna talk about Shang Ke. And I have a question before you begin. I was thinking about all the different relationships and Angela and Jenny and I were just talking about that.

If all relationships and everything we think, everything we do is in a pattern, right? We have a pattern of thinking, a pattern of acting. When we look at the five elements and we start creating the relationships that you're gonna talk about today, typically we're using five elements to see health, to see balance, but we also can look at using the Shang Ke relationship to see how we ourself analyze our own life, how we take action, how we see an event. Is that true? Yes, so that's all is a pattern.

The pattern means the pattern can be main, which is we human discover or create the pattern. All is a pattern of the natural pattern. So the pattern itself is different.

Like a 2025, the new car, you see that the new Toyota, new different kind of car, there's a pattern, they create one kind of pattern. There's a main creator, but the main cannot create the season. The main cannot create the moon pattern.

So no matter how many times you create a pattern, the moon still based on their own pattern and show you once a month and the full moon gonna to come. Some months have twice a full moon, some months and once a full moon. That's the pattern, that's called the natural pattern, never change, right? So we use the pattern as the mirror or use the pattern as the diamond, the mirror, right? We saw, we think that the mirror, what is the mirror? Mirror, mirror on the wall, right? On the wall.

So who look into the mirror? The inside the mirror and outside the mirror is the same or is it different? It's a mirror. So then therefore, when we use the, for example, we go back to the full moon again, the full moon, the night of the full moon. So the full moon shining down to the water.

Now you see the moon in the water. For the monkey, when you look at the water, oh yeah, I can grab in the moon. That's right, the monkey will be continued and the created pattern, we think the monkey will think the moon is in the water because yes, the mirror, the monkey will go to the water and try to scoop the moon.

But the man might look up, but how many people at the full moon will you look up to see the moon? You don't. You don't look up. You never care the full moon exist or not exist.

But the full moon doesn't care. That's their pattern. That's their destiny.

Doesn't matter you are man, you like or not because the moon exists. It's not just for human, for man only. We just discovered that, wow, that's very important, right? The woman just discovered, oh, my menstrual cycle is based on the full moon.

It's not based on my hormone level. It's based on the moon. If a moon doesn't come, my period cannot come.

My blood flow is based on the moon. It depends on the pattern. How do you want to see the pattern? How do you want to use the pattern, right? So that's why the wise man, whatever called the ancient masters, discovered that we cannot follow the man create the pattern.

We must be follow the nature's pattern. So that's why this course of purpose is introducing the one of the natural pattern. Remember, the natural pattern is the five elements pattern.

But these five elements pattern, the spirit or the key or secret behind this pattern is invisible part. It's not a visible part. So therefore, the visible part is in our three dimensional reality.

We can see, right? The fireman use water to control the fire. Why call the fireman? Not call water man. Because they use water.

They didn't use the fire to control the fire. They use water to control the fire, right? Why we not call the water man? Primer. They should be the primer and the water man, right? So we don't look at that.

We look at the man's means. Yes, the metal control the wood. I have a knife.

I can cut off the wood. That's what we think. Yeah, three dimensional reality 100% make sense, right? Metal cut off the wood.

So that's why you say metal control the wood. So the wood you say, okay, now look at the tree. The root go down to the ground and the change of the dirt and then the wood control the dirt.

Yeah, we see the dirt, earth. You build the dams to stop the water control. Yes, every time the water come, we use the same bag.

We use all of this dirt bag to try to stop the water. Yes, it makes sense. Absolutely at the three dimensional level.

Three dimensional level. So therefore for thousands of years, we are built up the consciousness mind. Remember consciousness mind control.

So that's why you see the English translation of the Xiang Ke directly say control. Why we need to control? Remember at the beginning, we say everything's cheap. All the cheap has a consciousness and all the consciousness has a purpose, right? Everything.

I mean, therefore, when we say control, what's the purpose of the control? Each one of you, please, I give you one minute. Think about that. What's the purpose of the control? When you think about the control, what's in your mind now? Control.

Why you need a control purpose? Why you need a control? Because in the society we be taught, we be educated something might get wrong if you are not control. So the control is based on the not trust. Doesn't have a faith of the natural law.

Doesn't have a faith everything is God's will. Even you say, I'm spiritual person. I believe in God.

I say, do you believe everything is God's will? You don't. You don't. You believe in control.

So that's why the word's translation would be immediately Xiang Ke will be the control. So therefore, highly recommend you guys, you should study the Chinese Xiang Ke instead English control. It's a totally different meanings.

Because the Chinese, this language is a picture language. It's a picture language. English is not a picture language.

So the every word has a picture. So what do we say? We say one picture is better than thousands of words. So the Ke itself is the picture.

So also we say everything exists. It's a fulfillment of God's will. Everything exists.

It's a fulfillment natural law. Otherwise they never can be exist in this three dimensional reality. Because purpose, right? We go back to the, again.

So when we study the Qi, Qi has a consciousness. And we say everything has a Qi. Nature's Qi, man's Qi, right? The Qi, everything has a Qi.

The Qi has a consciousness. And the consciousness is purpose. So therefore we create the language.

Every culture created their own language. What is the language? Then the language become Qi. The language contain the Qi.

Language contain the consciousness. So the Xiang Ke, this concept exists in Chinese culture for thousands of years. So therefore this Xiang Ke, the concept of the consciousness exists, created their own Qi.

Now you suddenly translate this Xiang Ke become English control. Does it make sense? Yes, they make sense. They only make sense one angle.

You have two hands. You cannot say left hand is my hand. Right hand is not my hand.

Because I'm left hand. The both is your hand, right? Even in your one hand, you don't say inside is my hand. Outside is not my hand.

You still, it's your hand. Include outside hand and inside hand. Did you complain to your mother? Why you give me the hand inside the color and outside the color different? Maybe someone can tell you, oh, because you're outside under the sun.

So therefore they change the color. Yes, make sense. But if someone never under the sun, can they do the same thing? No, still will be different.

Because what? It's natural law. It's a pattern. We go back to the concept of the Xiang Ke again.

Last week, we talked about the five element framework. Pull out the five element framework first. Last week, we talked about the five element framework.

So the five element framework, we talk about the outside the circle. So we follow this circle. Why we use the circle? Because we say, we try use Daoist concept to understand this natural framework.

We try to from the Daoist concept. In the Dao, one of the unique concept of the Dao is everything is a circle. Why? As the Zhuangzi says, idea is a circle, no beginning, no end.

Why no beginning, no end? Because they always connect, continues. That's Daoist concept. So the circle become so unique concept in everywhere from the nature to the unnatural, to our life, to our body.

Every pieces you see, you never see the body has angle. There's always circle. Life is a circle, day after days, right? I think the best circle concept in Western use is the 7-11.

They come out a good name, 7-11. That's why it's a circle, right? Never stop, 7-11. Come on, I'm shopping in 7-11.

Why? It always says something there, 7-11. It's a circle. So therefore, when we use a circle, we use outside the circle.

That's the pattern. In this pattern, when each element fell into this circle, now listen carefully, it's a pattern. This pattern is a circle pattern.

In this circle pattern, five elements, outside the pattern, circle, then each element fulfilled their own destiny. Each element changes their position. So therefore, in the outside of this circle, the wood will be the presenter.

Wood itself is the mother of the fire. Then also water will present herself. I am the child of the water.

You see? So each element will represent their own pattern, own position. They cannot change. They only can change compared to who.

But in that position, outside the circle, it's called the Xiangsheng circle. In this generation, in this circle, each element represents the mutual pressure. That's called the Xiangsheng.

In translated to English, maybe, right? Maybe more profound like creation. Something can be created out of support created. But if we follow inside that line, we still start with the wood element.

So the wood goes to the earth. Earth goes to the water. Water goes to the fire.

Fire goes to the metal. Metal go back to the wood. What's happening? They complete entire circle.

Now they are not a straight line anymore. They are circle. Show me the circle.

Now you can see. Now circle. Now, right? That's the circle.

Last week, we have in the other circle. Can you put the both circles side by side, please? That's a challenge, right? That's right. You cannot do side by side.

Okay. Now we do the Xiangsheng, right? So we ignore the inside the circle. We think they are disappeared.

They are not exist. We just doesn't want to see, right? I don't want to see the bad. I only want to see the good.

So therefore, I am the mother. I am control the situation. I control my kid.

Eat, sleep, shut up, go to the bathroom, right? Control. But unfortunately, it doesn't go that way, right? So therefore, outside the circle is called the Xiangsheng, right? So we're still missing the line on top of the E. So you need to add the one line. Because these two words is a straight pronunciation.

Please, guys, you really want, I say that before. Every words has a pronunciation. The vocabulary is a pronunciation.

The pronunciation is the sound. It's the sound meaning is the chi. It's a frequency.

Sound is a frequency. Why certain culture has a certain sounds? And in the other culture, difficult come up because of their meridians. Because of the meridians.

The meridians, the running differently and the sound coming through the flow. Difficult. And the same culture, same sounds.

And represent the certain consciousness. So you really want to know something so powerful things is the sound. All right.

So that's why some people can even use the sound maker for living, right? Sound, sound therapies. Wow, how exciting it is. Anyway, that's not what we're talking about.

We just talk about the outside the circle, mother, child. But this time, we say inside the dots. Now we put inside the dots.

Also as the circle. Now will be different kind of pattern, different framework. Same element, same element with a different framework.

Thinking this way. Think I want everybody don't jump too fast. You are who you are.

When you go home alone, you are alone. You just say, that's my house. When you find out your husband, you find out your wife.

What is a different relationship? Either you tend to yourself as husband, to yourself as wife or to yourself as a partner. Whatever you call relationship change, right? The pattern. When you go back to the office, maybe you are a CEO, CFO.

Maybe you are just a worker. Maybe you are just accounting, lawyer, whatever. Position change.

But you still you, right? You still you. But outside pattern change, then job change, purpose change. So Xiangke is the same element put into this circle.

Now it is a circle, right? We're still in this circle. They started with the wood again. Wood.

Now the wood goes to the earth. So the earth and the fire replaced. Now this relationship, this circle relationship represent them as the Xiangke.

Xiangke is one of the most, the most unique circle. Which means, which means in practical way in our clinic. Because we study this, we want to use.

In use, how to use? The Chinese have been using this for thousands of years. Xiangke, Xiangke, Xiangke. So all of this Xiangke means I'm controlling you.

I'm with you is mutual control. Which is always, they use this concept. Xiangke.

Ideas. Yeah. Wife.

Wife, Xiangke. Husband. Husband, Xiangke.

Which is these two people together always try to control each other. It's not control each other. English will be too difficult.

Too difficult to say that these ideas. If you're always angry, put it this way. You're friend of this person.

He or she can make you calm down. You become very melted. Yes.

All the anger. Every time you see her face, see his face. No matter how angry you are, you disappear.

That means him or her is your Xiangke. Has that kind of energy. Can calm you down.

Can, can profound you. Can make you become mellow. Right? The ke become this concept.

Because this concept is very important. Right? Important. The thousands years the concept of the ke.

Now we go back to this concept. The Xiangke the concept hasn't been used for thousands years. Hasn't been used for thousands years.

Never, never have a chance real go beyond. Because in situation we never have a chance. Go beyond to see the other faces.

The other levels of the Xiangke. The other levels of the control. We'll go back to that.

I still use the English of the control. This concept. Right? Retained what they call the control.

I mean retained. Right? Control something. So we say control purpose is based on something might go wrong.

Protect. Worry about something. And afraid about something.

So therefore I need real step in to control. Then often the control concept is always controlled effort. Right? Control outcome.

Never control the cost. There's always a cost. Control the effect.

So firemen. Have you seen the firemen nothing to do? Just driving the car and give the every house at the water. No.

Right? So only when the house has a fire. Then you see the firemen come. You know.

Spill the water to you. Then they have a fire. It exists.

Then the firemen can come. Right? Firemen can come. Something has to be used.

Otherwise you're not used. You just put it there. Hasn't used for effect.

And no one. No one will use this kind of control concept. Try to control the cost.

Can you imagine you understand this concept? How can I control the cost? Instead of control the effect. I think that's the most interesting concept for us. Because we want to use today for concept.

This concept hasn't been used all the time. Every disease as of today. We talk about the health.

In clinic. Everything what we see is always a control. Over control.

Either over control or under control. It's like we saw me. We saw me.

Right? We saw me. The element which is the liver. And the gallbladder can control the stomach.

But in the clinic. Have you seen it? No. You don't see these things.

All of today's disease or illness is over control. Or under control. For example.

Eszerifera. Eszerifera is liver. Which is the wood.

Over control. Has nothing to do with earth. It's over control.

So that's why you get Eszerifera. Right? Then the other things. TMJ.

Over control. Right? Your liver. Over control.

Your stomach. And the night time. So that's why you continue to chew it.

You cannot do that. Over control. There's so many things.

Supposedly. Right? Supposedly we think. Okay.

The fire. Suppose. Right? The fire.

The heart. Should control the lung. Right? Should make the lung more beautiful.

Have you seen it? No. None of them. You don't see.

Your most people. Your skin is dry. Over control.

Over control. In the clinic. We most symptoms.

As today. Out of balance. Because the life out of balance.

Emotional out of balance. So therefore. This natural processing.

Always out of balance. So the control. Always.

Most likely. It's over. And definitely has under.

Sometimes it's under control. Sometimes over control. I give you an example.

For example. Hyperpressure. The hyperpressure can be both.

Either over control. You can get hyperpressure. Or under control.

Also can get hyperpressure. Real dependent. When.

Where. How. What.

Then therefore. This concept. Control concept.

Is so easy. To use. And so easy.

To say. To say. So.

Every area. I will say that. Most.

Most common. Certain. The most common illness.

Disease. You. When you.

Goes to your. You know. Your doctors.

They always. You eat. They used.

Method. Is a control. How can I control.

Control the symptoms. Control that. Right.

Control the virus. Control the infections. Control.

Control. Control. Control.

One systems. To continue control. Now you see.

This circle. What's happening. The circle will be.

Continuous right. Because we say. It's in a circle.

Everything is a connect. So you control. With the control.

Control the other. So you. Also.

Control. We will tend to the circle. Then in the back.

You over control. Okay. You will control.

Instead. You are thinking. Oh.

How can I use. This concept. Not.

Just going to. Control. The outcome.

Control. The effect. And try.

To control. The cost. Now.

What is the cost. Many of you. If you listen.

To the chi. Listen to the consciousness. May always.

Name. I think. You should understand.

The cost. Always. At the chi level.

The cost. Always. At the.

Consciousness level. Without a truly. Understand.

This concept. Everything. Would you do as well.

You treat the sentence. So that's why you see. Why.

There's so many conditions. Never can be fixed. Because you are control.

How can you control. Right. Because the root cost.

Still hitting. Still behind. Look at that today.

How many people. Take a. Take a. Comment. Try to.

You know. Try to. What do you call the thing.

That you are. Blah. Afraid that you get.

You get a stroke. Again. Anytime.

Any people. Get a stroke. And they.

Take a comment. What. The thing.

What do you control. You control. The outcome.

Of the blood. Like who make blood. Which organ.

Blood. Make it a blood. Why you are making the blood.

Will be easier. Get a. Clock. See.

The whole. So. Many.

Questions. We ignore it. We don't want to know.

So this. The framework. Will make you.

Real thinking. What do you want to know. That's the first level.

After this. Control. Which is the circle.

Called the Xiang Ke. Concept. Now the second concept.

Right. Second concept. Let me do that one thing.

Second concept. It's good. Second concept.

For the Xiang Ke. The purpose of the Xiang Ke. The purpose.

Is to try to create a balance. We say. Five element.

Excuse me. Five element. Framework.

Is a. Naturalist framework. It's not a. Mainstay framework. But in the nature.

Is a framework. They are contained in oneness. They are contained in balance.

It's a natural law. So therefore. These natural law.

Contain the wisdom. So when they can. Performing.

This Xiang Ke concept. Is not. Just for this level.

The level. Or purpose. Of this Xiang Ke.

Is helping you. Eventually. To reach the level.

Of the balance. Because the body. Need to reach the balance.

In order healing. Self healing. Can start.

The entire Chinese medicine. The one of the beauty. Is to say.

The body. Inherited the wisdom. Can heal itself.

Right. We all heard. Our body can heal itself.

What is the requirement. The basic. First line.

Requirement. It's not a control. It's not a control.

The disease. It's not a control. The illness.

It's not a control. The problem. Is how to.

Create. The balance. Because once.

You can create the balance. And the body knows. How to heal itself.

Because once. We can. We reach.

The first level. Of the balance. May look at each organ.

You are. In this framework. In the first framework.

Is the Xiang Shen. And the mother child. Relationship.

They will unconditionally. Get support. Now.

You will go to the Xiang Ke. Framework. They will automatically.

Support. Now. Let me change the English.

Instead of saying Xiang Ke. Control. We should change the English.

Become support. Because the purpose. Is different.

Right. We say that the beginning. Be careful.

What you will. Use. Chose.

The vocabulary. Because the vocabulary. It is self.

The words. It is self. Contained.

Consciousness. So that's why. At the beginning was.

I say that. I want everyone. Think about the.

Controlled concept. But the support. And the control.

What's the difference. You guys should. Practice English.

And see the consciousness. Behind these two words. What's the difference.

The purpose. We go back to the game. The purpose.

Of this Xiang Ke. Is to reach to the balance. That's the purpose.

And therefore. And therefore. Each organ.

Each element. It is self. Inherited wisdom.

Inherited wisdom. And born to the. Responsibility.

To help. Any other organs. Must.

Reach. Balance. Must.

Reach balance. Must reach the balance. Then the body.

Can perform it. Body can perform. Self healing.

Repair. Right. You look at this whole concept.

Name therefore. Now therefore. I go back to the wood again.

The wood. With the earth. Liver.

With the stomach. Entire relationship will change. Entire relationship.

You wouldn't think. Okay. I'm having.

Or I eat this. Then I cause my acid reflux. Or I eat that sweet things.

My stomach grow up. Because that's the liver's. Responsibility.

To help. Stomach. This organ.

Your digestive system. Your metabolic function. In which highest level.

Then therefore. You can absorb. The nutrients.

Or energies. Or consciousness. From the food.

What you put into your body. That's the concept. That's the next level.

Of the Xiangke. So first the level. Is everybody think about it.

Superficial level. How do I control? That's right. Control the sentence.

But you know. Control never can reach the second level. Because who want to be controlled.

We all be the kids before. Do you want to be controlled by your parents? Do you want to be controlled. By your brother or sisters? Do you want to be controlled by your teachers? None of the people want to be controlled.

We all want to have a freedom. The deep down. No one want to be controlled.

Everyone. Everyone want to have a freedom. So the control concept.

Never can reach. The level of the balance. And harmony.

Because. Is at the consciousness level. Against natural law.

That is the one. If a doctor. If a practitioner.

If a life. Use this first level. Of the concept.

And super level of this. Visualize the control. You always make a mistake.

Because it's against natural law. Now. That is the second one.

Second level. We say the control. The concept.

What is the support. Right. It's the responsibility.

Right. It's the. They're called inherited responsibility.

They must. They must. Each element must.

To support. In the other organs. To reach.

The highest level. That's the responsibility. Because these two.

Must work together. In order to create a balance. Number three.

Right. The third. The third.

The character. Of this Xiangke. Remember at the Xiangsheng.

The character we say. The mother and the child relationship. Never can be broke.

The child always a child. Mother always a mother. These two.

Never can change. But the mother. Facing to.

Their mother. Next to. Is the mother.

And the child. But facing to their children. They are the mother.

So this relationship. Never can change. They have to main.

Contain that. In that framework. However.

In the Xiangke. Framework. Has a different kind of rule.

The rule. Will give you a. Has more. Flexibilities.

You can do some. So that's why I say. The most beautiful.

Most beautiful. Is the Xiangke. The Xiangke.

Has to go. Can go beyond. So when these two.

That mother control. Become. Compatible.

Become transformation. At the beginning. There's support.

Right. Support is the duty. The liver must be.

Support the stomach. Stomach must be. Support the kidney.

Each one's support. That's the first level. Support.

But if a support. Getting better. Something can go beyond.

They turn to the transformation. Turn to the. Oneness.

Then. Earth. Can go beyond.

Then the earth. Can combining. The wood.

Then the wood. And the earth. Can not be separate.

They become. Oneness. Yin and yang.

Can not be separate. That's at the beginning. When we talk about the yin yang concept.

Which is at that time. What you see. Is the circle.

Never can be separate. No matter what you cut. Through the center.

They are always together. So this level. Is the most.

How to call it. The most exciting level. Right.

The many good doctors. Does always try to reach this level. How can I create.

The possibility. To allow patients. To experience.

This transformation. This compatible. Right.

I change the English. You are compatible. You know.

You guys understand compatible. Right. They say this husband wife.

Oh these two people. Is compatible. The couple very compatible.

Right. That means look like the same thing. But transformation.

Is the difference concept. Right. So that means.

You are not just you. But you are different. Earth is not just Earth.

Digestive system. Is not just a digestive system. Digestive system.

Become. Become fearless. Think of it.

Does anyone eat. As of today. Most of the people.

A lot of people. Eating is based on the fear. Oh I cannot eat this.

Because I'm allergic to this. I'm allergic to this. I'm a gluten food.

You know. I'm allergic to gluten. I'm allergic to the vitamins.

They're allergic to something. So the eating is become fear. When we talk about the element.

It itself. We say the wood element. The one of the spirit.

Or one of the character. Of the wood is what. Fearness.

Fearness. Right. You see the tree grow.

Never afraid of wood. Never afraid it might be die. If I grow too fast.

I'm too high. You know. When the heavy wind come.

I might die. Does the tree grow. We afraid one day.

Wildfire come. I might be burn up. No.

They will catch every possibilities. And fully grow themselves. Every branch will stretch out.

To reach the sun. Right. To reach the wind.

They are not afraid. So the fearness. Is the concept.

So that's why when I tell the people. Say hey look at the dandelions. Right.

How simple this concept. That why you eat the dandelion. Because the dandelion contain the fearness.

The tree fearness. If people understand. But dandelion fearness.

Not the people understand. Dandelion fearness. Somehow.

Is a better name. The tree. Fearness.

Because we know. How many people want to kill the dandelion. Right.

How many you come from. Home Depot. Lowes.

The garden center. Everywhere. The farm.

They have to come. A kind of factory. And create a many different machines.

Try to kill the dandelions. I'm comfortable. So therefore.

Dandelion contain the fearness. Now. When the wood.

With herbs. When the liver. And the stomach.

These two organs. Can. Become transformation.

Can become beyond. The miracle happens. The miracle happens.

That is the third. Name number four. Number four.

In order to create this. The wood. We say the wood.

With the earth. Compatible. I want the earth.

I want to digest. If I say the liver one. The stomach can experience transformation.

But the liver must. Get the balance first. If a liver doesn't have this experience.

Of the transformation. Then therefore cannot support. Cannot help.

Stomach to experience. This transformation. Understand now? So that's why.

You have to see. Name each organs. Themself.

The balance. The harmony. The transformation.

It's a very important. So that's why we often heard people say. You want to help others.

Help yourself. You want to support others. Support yourself.

So that each organ. Or called each element. It is self.

Contained. You need. Two sides.

In and out. Now we bring the different concept. Into this concept now.

We say that we learned this yin yang concept. So if we say control is yang. Then.

Generation. You know. Generation.

Is yin. The mother child relationship is yin. Then.

Control relationship. Xiangsheng is yin. Xiangke would be the yang.

Follow me this one. Here is a little bit tough concept. So that means.

Each element contain the two sides. They can be the mother. They also can control.

They have two sides. Right? You see the wood. Wood can come out to the fire.

If wood go to the fire. Name is what? It's a Xiangsheng. If wood goes to.

The earth. It's a Xiangke. That means wood has a capability.

To show two sides. Two faces. At the same time.

And the yin and yang. Is a balance. So that each element itself.

Contain the two sides. Xiangsheng is the yin. And the Xiangke would be the yang.

There's always two sides. So therefore. There's each element.

Has a capability. Yin and yang. You cannot say.

I give out the more. If you can give out the more. As the mother and the child.

Then you should be able. To control the more. It's a control.

Or support. Now think of this. Pull out the five element.

Framework first. For example. We still use the wood first.

So if a wood goes to the fire. It's a Xiangsheng. Mutual creation.

Right? Mother and the child. So then the fire is a child. So when the fire getting bigger.

And the child grow up. Turn to the mother again. Now goes to the earth.

The fire and the earth. Is a mother and a child. Now if you look at it.

So what is the relationship? You look back for the wood tribe. To the earth. What is? It's a grandma now right? You upgrade.

So does grandma control the grandkids? Sometimes you see a lot of time. Grandma want to control. They think that's my kid.

No that's not your kid. Legally. He's not your kid.

It's your grandkid. Legally. Come on.

You study this five element. Framework. Will definitely gonna to help you.

Understand this relationship. I definitely believe someone. You all have these issues.

Why my daughter doesn't allow me. See my grandkid. It's not your kid.

It's your grandkid. Understand? So the grandma become this time is what? It's a support your babysitter. You just get a support.

Right? Big wish. It's a different. It's a different relationship.

So the soul you need. You see that's always support. Support.

Right? Maybe once you do this one. You see if a two generation. There's always one supporter.

Two generation. There's only one support. You see that? How interesting.

Once these three together. Then create the other circle. Which is we're going to live this one.

For the next class. Right? So this class. Will make your real thinking.

Is Xiang Ke. The character. Right? The character.

The unique character. How this happens. Because this Xiang Ke concept.

In the clinic. Always happens. Always.

Everywhere. You see this either over. Or under.

It's always. Right? In the most situation. Why? Life.

One is the life cost. Second is the concept. Concept.

We are not going to. The root cause issue. We always try to deal.

The effect. Every step. Every step.

Or every method. Or technique. Or even medicine.

Or even herb. Don't think the herb is doing. You know.

People doing herb. Is they are natural. Right? They use natural.

For unnatural purpose. Violently. Use natural to the unnatural.

Always try to. Control. Or stop.

Effect. Instead of trying to find the cost. So.

I would like each one of you. Right? That's the homework. Use this concept.

To look back to yourself. It's the same thing. Condition.

Your physical condition. Your mental condition. Right? Maybe even your life.

How many times you want to control? I think most of you. How to drive. You know how to drive your car.

The wheel. Right? You're holding that. You don't hold it.

Right? Do you real control? If it drives smoothly. You just almost. You just touch it.

You never hold tight. You never want to hold control. Right? You have control.

You cannot drive. You have to cooperate. You have to know.

How to. Smoothly. And then you can drive.

Anyone ride a horse. You know. Can you real control that? You can.

If you control too high. Horse doesn't run. Right? Everything in the real life.

You have to see this part. Right? In swimming. Do you real control? You when you're in the water.

Do you control? You don't control. Can you control the water? Can you control yourself? No. You have to work with the water.

Then you become the water. So all that this concept. My opinion.

So we will help us to understand. Our concept of this called the main. Has a power.

Has knowledge. We can control the circulation. We can control the environment.

Global warming. We try to control the global warming. Do you think we can control? We think that the earth is too much heat.

And we can do something. The earth is only one tiny planet. In our solar system.

Even earth want to be destroyed by itself. Mercury. Other planets.

Sun and the moon. Wouldn't agree. They wouldn't allow these things to happen.

Do you think we can do that? Right? So somehow. These five element framework. Will make us really think who we are.

What are we doing? Right? If that element. That pattern. That framework.

It's a natural framework. Can be applied for everywhere. Also apply in our body.

Then therefore. When our body function. It's based on the what? It's based on the outside of this framework.

It's not based on what we think. We chose the best food. We do this.

Because each element itself. Each organ itself. Fulfilled their own destiny.

Their own wisdoms. So that's why we call the chi. Consciousness.

And purpose. That's enough for this class. So I can open up for questions.

Okay. Go ahead Erla. Good morning.

So this is really great. Thank you. And.

I guess what I want to say first is. What I feel like I've learned from today. Is that.

Last week's relationship. The mother child is. Is actually more profound.

And I will. And I'm surprised about that. I wasn't expecting that.

Because what I learned today is. That the this relationship. That Xiangke is is young.

I was surprised about that. I thought that was going to be the in. So I understand that we can get.

Like parts of you know. The characteristic from the support organ. In today's relationship right.

But last week was more profound. Because last week. It's the most important thing is.

You become who you are. Which I feel at the end of today. Is the most important thing.

Okay so. Today's talk is all about. Like getting to excitement.

Which is harmony. Transformation and harmony. So that's really exciting.

And I feel like once you can get. Once you get to the start of transformation. Wow.

It's all really fast and exciting. But before that. You have to get to balance.

Which you talk about today right. You have to get to the balance part. And that seems like that image.

Is just kind of hard stuck. How do you get balance? That's my question. It's like how do you.

How do you define balance? Before you get to the excitement. That's why most of the people never see. The other part of the capability right.

So that's why the Xiang Ke. This relationship. This framework.

Not many people can experience. Can use in the highest level. Right so you only can use.

For superficial level control. In the super you know. Because contained.

Contained situation. By our limited understanding. Limited understanding.

The outcome of the situation right. Right it's like how. Everything what you do.

Is try to contain the outcome. Of the situation. Because the source.

The cause the situation. Is always at the consciousness level. Invisible level.

Unless you can go beyond this level. Everything what you do. It's still superficial.

Doesn't matter you use the needle. You use the herb. You can say that I'm treating root cause.

You never treat the root cause. You still treat the sentence. So the beauty this week.

Learn the Xiang Ke. The beauty of the Xiang Ke. Is something.

The two can go beyond. Can two can become oneness. Two totally upset.

Is Xiang Ke. At the beginning is Xiang Ke. Xiang Ke meaning is two totally upset.

Water and fire. Never relate. How can water and fire living together.

Side by side. Yes right. Have you seen the fire under the water.

Look at the fire can burn under the water. Xiang Ke can be Xiang Sen. Can be a transformation.

Right so when these two. Can be totally upset. They go beyond together.

And the higher dimensional level. They can become oneness. That is the beauty of the five elements.

Framework. Experience. This one.

Right how can I go beyond. Itself. How? Balance.

So that each organ contain the balance. Each element contain the balance. Right so that's why we go to the next class.

Now because of these two of the major. Concept once we can understand. Once we can.

How to call it. Understand or. Comprehend a little bit.

And then when the next week. We do the whole system. Meaning elements together.

We create a team. You know now you'll be able to see. Oh how to create team.

Team effort. How do I create for this part. These two parts.

One is the Xiangkeng. Xiangsheng one is Xiangke. All right.

How can I let these two can play together. And to create the team efforts. To get.

Thank you Orla. Thank you. Hi Sergio.

Good morning. Hello. Good morning dear master.

Good morning everyone. Thank you very much master for. This class.

Beautiful class. I have a question about. Masculine men health.

Their prostate. Prostate gland. Is related.

To which element. First. And second one.

How. How the prostate gland. Is related to.

In Xiangsheng. And Xiangke. Patterns or relationship.

Can you explain a little bit about. The prostate gland in the men. Which element is related to.

And this circle. Pattern of circles. You go too fast.

That's supposed to should be the next week. Or next week of the class. You know.

Or the apply to the clinic. You know real situation. All right.

I can quickly tell you. Because the prostate concept. Is the kidney concept.

Ideal is a kidney. Or is the bladder in the kidney. So therefore.

You have to figure out. You have to figure out. How do I balance this water.

How do I do that. And which organ issues. It's a kidney.

Because it is in fact. Effect of your kidney. And the bladders.

These two. The water elements be effect. What cost.

There are so many. There are so many issues. Can cost by the liver.

Can cost by the heart. Can cost by. So you have to see which part.

You have to see. Which is the first. Priority.

Even though that's the condition. The prostate is a condition. But the cost.

Can be others price. Right. Okay.

Thank you. We will get into several. Clinical cases.

Over the next few weeks. So. Hold on with those questions.

Anyone else. Clara. Did you have a question.

Okay. You popped up on my screen. Anyone else.

So Master Liu. When we talk about. The mother child relationship.

And then you talk about. The support relationship. There is an importance.

Of course. To the mother child relationship. What makes the support.

And transformation process. So profound. Because they can go beyond.

That's a can go. And that can go beyond. Right.

Linking. Just like a window. Would try to support.

The earth. Linking. Let the earth.

Go beyond the earth itself. Unlike. If a mother goes in like a heart.

It's the mother. You know. Heart goes to the stomach.

The stomach. It cannot go beyond. The stomach is still with the stomach.

The other one can go beyond. Gotcha. So in many ways.

That whole triangulation. Becomes the most important factor. It's the most important.

The concept. I'm telling you. Put this.

All the secret of the Daoist Qigong practice. That's always. Always.

How to. How to. Organize.

Or how to make this. Xiang Ke. Relationship.

Become oneness. Like a heart. Water.

And fire. Killing. And the heart.

99.9% of people. Out of balance. Out of balance.

Which means. Your mental. And your killing.

Your genetic code. Out of balance. 99% of people.

Never have a chance. Not call fully. Just a little bit.

To see. Your inherent wisdom. The all at the killing.

You never can be balanced. Look at how simple. Sleeping.

How many people can do that? No. Why? Heart and killing. Fire and.

Fire and water. The two of these. Cannot be balanced.

If balanced. Your sleeping has no issue. Memory has no issue.

Longevity has no issue. Right. That's one of the most important.

Upper body. Lower body. It's a heart.

And the heart. And the killing. Fire and water balance.

That's all. In the practice. Qigong practice.

Left. Right. Left side.

Is the dragon. Right side. Is the tiger.

All the ESP. Psyche capability. They're all based on the liver.

In the liver. In the lung. Dragon.

In the tiger. This relationship. If it is a relationship.

You know how to do that. So which means. You see the cycle.

You see the circle. Bring the circle out. Right.

The. Winter sauce. Right.

Now another piece one. Yes. You see the summer sauce.

Winter sauce. The summer sauce is. Heart.

Winter sauce. Is killing. One is on the highest.

One is on the. And the left side is what. Spring equal night.

And the fall equal night. That's totally balance. Only these two times.

Can get the balance. The balance is a balance. Entire earth.

Left and the right. How difficult. Look at like a simple.

Your lung. And your liver. And the 99.9% of people.

Never get the balance. If a balance. You don't have a liver issue.

In the today. 80% the disease. At the today.

Is caused by the liver. How can be. If a lung will do.

Lung real can support. Real can do this job. And the liver never have issue.

Okay. Right. Digest the system.

Look at today. The digest system. So which means.

You think that. You think that this earth. Go back to five elements again.

Right. Your earth. Your digest system.

Earth. With your kidney. Water.

We say. All of this. Digest the system.

Is your acquired immune system. The kidney. And the bladder.

Is your innate immune system. So you have. Two kind of immune system.

That's the most. On the mainstream. Only focus on acquired.

But the entire. Entire blood line. Entire spiritual line.

Innate immune system. You don't know how to use. So if you can make this a tool.

Earth. And the waters. Balance.

Go beyond it. What kind of viruses. What kind of disease.

What kind of COVID. You don't need the COVID. Double.

Triple the COVID. Nothing can. You are.

Unbelievable. No one can beat you. You are undefended.

Right. Because your immune system. Will be there.

That's nothing. Can cost. Any kind of human.

So therefore. This is. I'm telling you.

This kind of. Inside the circle. There's so many.

Mysteries. Because they can go. Beyond.

They can. Once called the beyond. That means.

Once this. And the two entities. Can be.

One. Can you imagine. One.

Hand. Hold the whole thing. Then two organs.

Can show. That's the one. Very powerful.

Thank you. Well we've reached our. Maximum time limit.

So thank you so much. Do the homework. Guys.

So you know. I know I go beyond. I say the too much.

So but. I really think. You guys should.

Study more. And. Put this.

There's a lot of information. You know. Information.

Maybe. That's the first time. You can hear that.

A lot of time. You know. Never existed.

In the classical. Chinese book. Okay.

Study this. When the next week. When we go.

To the deep. Now. You'll be able to.

Play this. Be able to see. Otherwise.

You will be more. Confused. All right.

Thank you so much. Master Liu. And have a. Take care.

Okay. Bye. Thank you very much.
