## Born for Wealth — Day 2 (verbatim-extract, cleaned & structured)

### Session start / Housekeeping
- "How are you guys doing today? Good? Haven't got a nice rest yesterday? Do you guys sleep well? Type the word yes if you sleep well yesterday. You sleep like a baby. Wow, good."
- "Okay. Yeah, but not my team. The team here, actually, yesterday, they are barely sleeping because they tried to help all of you here."
- "You know what happened yesterday, right? Yeah, they want to register for the program but somehow they cannot get in and then they sent a long message to the team here so they work around the clock just to help you guys fix the problem. So I've been told that it's already fixed, right? For everyone here? Okay. Yeah, because yesterday they are so stressed."
- "They told me I got so many messages coming in and they don't know what to do. Yeah, pity them. But I'm sure I'm going to buy them a special dinner after today's program."
- Team contacts (as spoken): "Kerry, SK, Dyson, Steph, William."
- Telegram / channel notes:
  - "This is the telegram channel for Born for Wealth."
  - "This is not my telegram channel, my official one. This is specific for Born for Wealth students."

## Chapter 4 — Multimillionaire Feng Shui setup (Period 9)

### Purpose / When feng shui helps
- "So first of all, we need to know why we use feng shui."
- "Feng shui able to open another capacity for you if you already max out. But if you're someone lazy, you haven't maxed out anything... feng shui cannot help you at all. Even you live in the best feng shui house, because feng shui just amplify what you already have."
- "Feng shui amplifies stuff."
- "If you are lazy and you move. Yes, Yaidi mentioned correctly, right? So, for example, what happens when you motivate an idiot? You get what? Motivated idiot."

### Core concept: Proximity
- "Proximity means what is the distance between you and the good energy."
- "If every day, if your house got good energy, and every time you go back, don't you think those good energy will affect you? Within proximity, right?"
- Example: second house (you don't stay there) — "No effect at all."

### How to compare houses / relative improvement
- "First of all, you must make sure the new feng shui house, although it's good, is it better than the current feng shui house that you're living in?"
- "If they cannot compare with your current one, let's say it's worse than your current one, even you so-called move into a new house that claim to be good feng shui, but it's a bad feng shui to you... you actually constrain yourself and you go to low level again."

### Mountain & Water (earth-realm fundamentals)
- "There are two forces that govern the earth realm."
- "Very simple is the mountain and water. The mountain is the yin, water is the yang. When these two are in balance, you get good feng shui."
- "If you go to an area, there are no hill or mountain or higher terrain, and there absolutely no water. Would you buy that area? No."
- "Mountain will take precedence when it comes to period nine."

Examples of rich neighborhoods (verbatim examples used to illustrate mountain preference):
- "Beverly Hills, the northern part of it... foothills around the Santa Monica area."
- "Hampstead... one of the highest point in London."
- "Victoria Peak (Sun Tang) in Hong Kong — the wealth rises to the hill, overlooking the water."
- "Bukit Timah in Singapore."

Notes:
- "If you need to choose one, choose mountain."
- "Mountain or hill itself is already good. This is additional function that each of them have."

### Period 9 technical note (HER2, Lu Shu)
- "HER2, this is a metaphysics things. Lu Shu is the applied science."
- "Period nine is very yang element because it's powerful."
- "When the element is too yang... you need to apply yin. So now mountain and water, which one represent yin element? Mountain."

### External (70%) vs internal (30%)
- "External, which is the mountain of water, governs 70%. And what you do inside the house just govern 30%."
- "If you can't move mountains, work on the 30% internal optimizations: 'If your salary increased by 30%, are you happy or not? ... it's quite powerful too.'"

## Know your house — Facing & Period (practical steps)
- Two required items: "Facing direction of your house" and "the period."
  - Facing direction: "If you live in a high-rise, you need to go out from the building... take the facing direction of the building instead your own unit."
  - Landed: "stand here, roughly at the center... this is the facing direction."
- "You need to know whether it's South 1, South 2 or South 3" — 24 mountains reference (team will send `24 mountains reference chart`).
- Period:
  - High-rise: "look at the first occupant moving in" → building period.
  - Landed: "Period for landed property is the year you move in."

## Flying Star method (how to apply fast for Period 9)
- "Flying star Feng Shui is one of the system. If you do it, mentioned going to wait 20 years... For now, all right, I want to talk about the fast way."
- Wealth in Period 9: top-right numbers matter (top-right sector).
- Wealth numbers to memorize (Period 9): "nine, one, two, four."  
  - "In period nine, we want fast, right? So which of this is the fastest? Number nine."
- Wealth palaces (constant in Period 9): "north, east, southeast and southwest."

### Practical rating / scoring (quoted system)
- "If you've got number four, you've got 40 points. If you've got number one, 30 points. Number two is 10. Number four, pretty good, 20."  
- Process:
  1. "Circle all the wealth palaces first. East, southeast, southwest and north."
  2. "Check the top-right number in each box to see if it's 9/1/2/4"
  3. "Apply the rating... you can compute the rating just like seconds."

### Activation triggers (doors/windows/placement)
- "If you see a door here? Is it good? Yes. Which means it's already activated. Automatically. It's already. You already have... 24-7 subscription already."
- "If there is a window around this area, you open it. It will also allow the energy to come in."
- "This is called automatic trigger. If it's not, you need to do it manually. You move there and stay there and look there."

## Nobleman (noblemen) feng shui (fast-collaboration activation)
- "So in period nine, nobleman feng shui technique becomes super important."
- "Nobleman is pig and rooster" (example tied to a yang fire day-master quote): "So if you are a yang fire... your nobleman is pig and rooster. Therefore it located in the northwest... and west too."
- Activation options:
  - "Open a sliding door, open window or main door — it's already activated."
  - "If you don't have a window... move in that area to work. You position you in that area to work. To attract noblemen."
- Monthly activation & Tung Shu:
  - Use monthly flying star charts to see which month the target star lands in your nobleman sector.
  - "If you discover that number 9 arrives in my Northwest box from February 4th until March 4th? Yes or no? Yes. So this is my activation month."
  - For precision: choose a peak day from the Tung Shu (peak day).

Precautions:
- "Avoid number 5 (5 yellow) for that year" — "For example, in 2026 the 5 yellow resides in the South."

Activation technique (safe, low-risk):
- "You move a furniture in and out just to stir up the energy a little bit, then it will get activated."
- "Use sound... or a fan... switch it on for like 10 minutes, stir up the energy a little bit, it consider activation."

- Star 2 example: "4th of November ... you got earth, you got disruptor, you got life door. Confirm. So when you see this, you got what? Depth release frequency... back to northwest on that day, 4th of November, and then ask for something you want at that day."
- Star 3 example: "December 17 ... needs to be in the Southwest... must have a chief and a life door."
- Star 4 example: "19 December ... heart and open door ... rewind timing activation."
- Star 5 example: "Attracting the right people... check the chart, e.g., certain students see formation for the day."

## Chapter 6 — Investment (summary & practical framework)

### Super-rich playbook (three things)
- "Value creation: you need to be useful all the time... continue to learn."
- "Master cash allocation."
  - "Net profit... the remaining, let's say you, after minus all your expenses, you got 10,000. This is the ratio you need to put."
  - "60% in safety, 30% on investment and another 10% in NQA (no question asked)."
  - "Every time you have money coming in, allocate in these three buckets when you're extra."
- "Energy management (manage energy rather than time)."

### Creation → Allocation → Growth loop
- "Creation is where you improve your value... then allocation... investment (growth)... reinvest earnings back into creation and education... compounding loop."
- "Making money is not a matter of intelligence. It's a matter of consistency in following the plan."

### Direct wealth vs Indirect wealth (IR)
- "There are two stocks. So direct wealth and indirect wealth..."
- "Indirect wealth is better when you're talking about making more money through investment. Because indirect wealth don't have limit."
- "Indirect wealth is heavenly wealth... tin choy."
- IR (Indirect Resource) is linked to the Hour pillar (investment pillar): "Indirect resource penetrate to the top from the month... it's strongly rooted."

### Investment superpower (hour pillar mapping)
- "Look at your hour pillar — animal sign. That gives you an investment style / affinity."
- Three investment styles by hour-animal group:
  - Vision: "tiger, snake, monkey or pig" — "able to actually discover potential before the world catch on... growth investing."
  - Momentum: "good in move with market rhythm... follow the trend... compound success through flow."
  - Legacy: "dragon, dog, ox or goat" — "value investing... patient... long-term proven companies."

### Asset-class affinity mapping
- "Find the animal in your hour pillar, then map to the asset class suggested by the chart shared in Telegram."
- "If you don't know your hour pillar, use your luck pillar or the five-structure strongest element as fallback."

### Timing for investing — mindset correction
- "If you invest in a good time, means that you're in a good mental state. Therefore you can make a better decision."
- Warnings:
  - "Clash = impulsive investing."
  - "Harm = greed-related mistakes. Be careful of greed; scammers exploit greed."
