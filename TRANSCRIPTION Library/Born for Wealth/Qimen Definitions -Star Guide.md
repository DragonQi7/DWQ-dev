1) Ambassador

- Clear rewrite (preserving meaning):
  Ambassador is a wealth-focused star and mindset. It represents thinking related to treasure and steady income flow. In practical use you locate the ambassador on your chart (directional placement, e.g., Northwest) and perform directed manifestation to install an ownership/wealth mindset. Ambassador + Earth supports consistent abundance.

- Verbatim excerpts (exact):
  - Line 475: "So now there's an ambassador, you know, ambassador is about wealth opportunities. Okay. And then Bing and Wu form a flying bird." (`TRANSCRIPTION Library/Born for Wealth/Born for Wealth - ALL.txt`)
  - Line 561: "So now if you look at here, if you, I just explain the technical part a little bit here, this, this chart here, you have ambassador. Ambassador is always wealth mindset because ambassador represent thinking and then earth represent treasure. Okay." (`TRANSCRIPTION Library/Born for Wealth/Born for Wealth - ALL.txt`)
  - Lines 2110–2114 (instruction/context): "So you see this star here. This is your star. So if your ownership, if your ownership, you look at what star? Ambassador." / "So ambassador, there's one direction here, right? Say Northwest. So to install this mindset, you back to the Northwest direction and do manifestation. Okay." (`TRANSCRIPTION Library/Born for Wealth/Born for Wealth - ALL.txt`)
  - Line 6166: "You need the manifestation of flow of consistent abundance. And why I'm showing you, um, this one here, um, Ambassador and Earth.

2) Assistant

- Clear rewrite (preserving meaning):
  The assistant star denotes benefit, creativity and intelligence (a growth/wood element). It supports wisdom and strategic action; when combined with courage (harm dog) it makes courage effective rather than reckless. Assistant forms useful synergies in manifestation protocols.

- Verbatim excerpts (exact):
  - Line 681: "People might attack you politically agree or not. So you must have that fighting power to go through this, to rise and don't worry because you have a chief with you, he protects you.

  - Line 683: "Assistant star represent intelligent. A lot of people think the harm dog represent courage attack, right? It only used to when you are smart. Imagine you are very courageous, but you're stupid." (`TRANSCRIPTION Library/Born for Wealth/Born for Wealth - ALL.txt`)
  - Line 687: "Then now you are brave, yet you're intelligent. When you're intelligent, you know when to attack, when you need to hold back. Agree or not? So assistant star represent intelligence." (`TRANSCRIPTION Library/Born for Wealth/Born for Wealth - ALL.txt`)
  - Line 6361: "Assistant means beneficial. This is a great star. Assistant also represent creativity." (`TRANSCRIPTION Library/Born for Wealth/Born for Wealth - ALL.txt`)
  - Line 6363: "So you form synergy. Because assistant is a wood element. It's a growth star." (`TRANSCRIPTION Library/Born for Wealth/Born for Wealth - ALL.txt`)

3) Grass

- Clear rewrite (preserving meaning):
  Grass (sometimes called heavenly grass) is the wealth/leverage star related to scaling and entrepreneurial style. It favors automation, efficiency and "fastest way" solutions. In charts the grass is located at a particular direction (context shows West) and it supplies intellect/wisdom that, combined with courage, makes action productive.

- Verbatim excerpts (exact):
  - Line 779: "All right. So this is the one of the thing you want to actually look into this. So now the, when a rest door grass or so water, the grass also lazy one, you know, they always find the fastest way to do things." (`TRANSCRIPTION Library/Born for Wealth/Born for Wealth - ALL.txt`)
  - Line 803: "So now back to the grass and the rest door and why this rest door is super important because it's an envoy. Rest door is lazy. Envoy represent super lazy." (`TRANSCRIPTION Library/Born for Wealth/Born for Wealth - ALL.txt`)
  - Line 807: "And they tell me the grass is from a river because grass is an entrepreneur style because if you work for others, it's very hard for you to be super lazy, right? Entrepreneur, there's no way. There's no way to innovate, to automate so many things. So it gives you the entrepreneur mindset, the grass style." (`TRANSCRIPTION Library/Born for Wealth/Born for Wealth - ALL.txt`)
  - Lines 2244–2254 (chart/location context): "IR are related to which stars in Shiman. Grass, right? Still remember it's a grass. Yeah." / "So now I bring up a sample Shiman chart right now... IR just now for two to five is the grass." / "So now all the stars, the tops are center, right? So you look all the, and we discover the grass. This is the grass. Notice the green." / "So where is the grass? The grass is here. Do you guys see it? The grass. Okay." / "So therefore IR related to grass, right? So now where is the grass located? West. So what you need to do, you sit down, I'm back in drawing. Okay." (`TRANSCRIPTION Library/Born for Wealth/Born for Wealth - ALL.txt`)
  - Lines 6393–6395 (functional role): "So the grass gives you the wisdom, the intellect. And with courage, then only you become powerful. Courage alone is dangerous." / "Agree or not? You just charge forward. Yeah, you might not know whether it's something worth pursuing or not. But with the grass, they know." (`TRANSCRIPTION Library/Born for Wealth/Born for Wealth - ALL.txt`)

4) Hero

- Clear rewrite (preserving meaning):
  The hero star is tied to visibility, branding and being the public-facing "hero" of a project. Use the hero star direction on your chart to support branding and launch activities; it’s the star to target for visibility/branding initiatives.

- Verbatim excerpts (exact):
  - Lines 2116–2128 (instruction/context): "Let's say you're part of branding. Let's say you're under branding group or you, let's say this here is about branding. Then you need to do one thing here is you need to actually look for hero." / "And then what you need to do, you look at the direction here is East, right? You back to the East. ... look at your achievement chart, look for where the hero star is." (`TRANSCRIPTION Library/Born for Wealth/Born for Wealth - ALL.txt`)
  - Line 4057 (direction reference): "Direction already gave you in chapter number one, right? Remember, backing to which one, either the grass or the hero. If you miss out chapter number one, you watch it on replay again. Okay." (`TRANSCRIPTION Library/Born for Wealth/Born for Wealth - ALL.txt`)
  - Line 7291: "And like for me, I'm just talking, right? Nothing much. But for them, they are the real hero behind. Okay." (`TRANSCRIPTION Library/Born for Wealth/Born for Wealth - ALL.txt`)

5) Heart

- Clear rewrite (preserving meaning):
  The heart star is the emotional/relationship seat in the chart and functions as a key manifesting anchor (it is aligned with the Qian gua/open door concept in the teaching). Pairing heart with open-door placements (and envoys) makes a manifesting moment stronger. The heart’s directional placement (example: Southwest in the teaching) is used when installing the heart-centered mindset.

- Verbatim excerpts (exact):
  - Lines 6337–6343 (manifesting via heart/open door): "Yeah, easy. You just look for heart and open door. Because this, when you have this, because heart is a Qian Gua, open door also a Qian Gua." / "You look at 19 December, there'll be a good one. Do you see it, 19 December? Okay, you see here, heart, open door. Okay, this one, although this the only criteria we need, but do you see this Envoy here? Envoy make it even better." (`TRANSCRIPTION Library/Born for Wealth/Born for Wealth - ALL.txt`)
  - Line 2120 (direction): "Heart here is Southwest, right? So therefore you back to the Southwest." (`TRANSCRIPTION Library/Born for Wealth/Born for Wealth - ALL.txt`)
  - Line 4057 (context link to other directions): "Direction already gave you in chapter number one, right? Remember, backing to which one, either the grass or the hero. If you miss out chapter number one, you watch it on replay again. Okay." (`TRANSCRIPTION Library/Born for Wealth/Born for Wealth - ALL.txt`)
