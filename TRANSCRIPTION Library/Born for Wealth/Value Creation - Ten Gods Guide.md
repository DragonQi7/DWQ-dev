# Value Creation Guide by Ten Gods (BaZi)

Purpose: Turn each Ten God into a practical “value engine” you can deploy. This complements the Born for Wealth framework: 
- Ownership = IW/DW
- Creation = EG/HO
- Leverage = IR/DR
- Branding = F/RW
- Scaling = DO/7K

Use with: your “value-creation element” (top stem of the Man pillar) and your Annual top stem for Period 9 speed. For mindset installs, back to the matching Qi Men star: Ambassador (Ownership), Assistant (Creation), Grass (Leverage), Hero (Branding), Heart (Scaling).

Abbreviations: DW (Direct Wealth), IW (Indirect Wealth), HO (Hurting Officer), EG (Eating God), DR (Direct Resource), IR (Indirect Resource), DO (Direct Officer), 7K (Seven Killings), F (Friend), RW (Rob Wealth).

## Deployment Checklist
1) Identify your Man pillar top stem (your native value-creation style).
2) Note this year’s Annual top stem (fastest path in Period 9). Align projects accordingly.
3) Install mindset: back to the relevant Qi Men star; read the path mantra 5–10 minutes.
4) Pick one 30‑day sprint from your Ten God and execute; track KPIs weekly.
5) Add the missing counterweight (e.g., HO needs EG substance; DW needs IR leverage).
