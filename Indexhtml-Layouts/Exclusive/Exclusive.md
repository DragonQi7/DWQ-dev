Highlights common challenges: many people study QI GONG but see limited results because they focus on the wrong things.


Encourages participants to start fresh, temporarily setting aside previous knowledge to focus on what truly works.

Introduces the concept of energy and the five elements (Fire, Earth, Metal, Water, Wood) as foundational to understanding how the world and destiny function.

Each element has Yin and Yang forms, totaling 10 elements.

Elements govern fluctuations in life, behavior, and fortune.

Emphasizes the three realms: Heaven (time ), Earth (enviornment)  , and Man (relationships), and that health can be approached in all three.

Focuses on  Heaven realm first, stressing alignment with purpose and clarity about desires.

Introduces two paths to Health

Pre-heaven Fate – born with wealth (acceptance required).

Post-heaven - Destiny – can be influenced through strategy, effort, and qigong.
